# **Navigating layers**

-   On the left hand side you will see the legend of the layers, the blue outlines are the Regional Board Boundaries, and the different Indigenous Territories are color coded and defined on that menu.

-   You can click on a map area of California to find out what Regional Board, or Indigenous Territory is there. The information will be shown in a pop-up menu.

-   On this example, the right border of California was clicked and a pop-up showed that the area belongs to Regional 6 of the Regional Boards
