    "text": "When planning for your data project with an equity lens, it’s best to conduct a thorough equity assessment, or scoping process. Equity assessments1 are systematic examinations of available data and expert input on how various groups - especially those facing inequity or disparities - are or likely will be affected by a policy, program, or process. They aim to minimize unintended adverse outcomes and maximize opportunities and positive outcomes.\nThe steps to conducting an equity assessment are described below.\n\nStep 0: Project Scoping\nStep 1: Describe the selected program, policy, or process, and populations affected by it\nStep 2. Consider historical, societal, and policy context and drivers of disparities\nStep 3. Collect expert input, including from affected community members\nStep 4. Identify information sources and gaps\nStep 5. Analyze program/policy effects - potential or current - on people and communities\nStep 6. Plan for action and accountability\n\nAlthough these steps are numbered for clarity, teams should synthesize information from all steps rather than completing them in isolation or one at a time.\n\n\nTime frame and level of effort:\n\nPlan a detailed schedule that accounts for staff availability, budget, technical assistance needs, data availability, and the need to make decisions in a particular time frame.\nIdentify and document risks to the timeline, such as staff availability, or threats to the comprehensiveness of the assessment, such as lack of access to experts. Consider potential ways to mitigate risks.\n\nProject team:\n\nDefine roles for team members and assign responsibilities. Plan to share information at key milestones to synthesize information from different assessment steps.\nConsider how to meaningfully involve experts, including people with lived experience with relevant programs and topics; people in communities affected by the program, policy, or process; staff who work with program participants/beneficiaries; or representatives of other offices. Experts can contribute to the assessment process in several ways, such as suggesting data sources, providing multiple perspectives to inform and enhance the analysis, and developing recommendations for action.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the focus of the assessment to provide a foundation for all members of the assessment team and external partners.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the selected program, policy, or process, and what are its goals?\nWhat are the known successes or challenges in meeting those goals?\nWhat types of actions or policy levers are involved in the selected program, policy, or process (such as grants, contracts, waivers, guidance to partners, technical assistance, or other actions)?\nWhich of these actions will be included in the assessment?\nWhat general descriptive or performance data can the organization use to describe the program, policy, or process (such as number served, total funds distributed, uptake estimates, or other key outcomes)?\nAre there existing quantifiable performance targets relevant to the focus of the assessment? Provide a brief summary.\n\nIdentify and describe populations of interest\n\nWhat populations are participating in the program, policy, or process, including program participants/beneficiaries? Consider which characteristics are relevant and of interest, such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, income, religion, and rural geography.\nWhat populations are currently left out, or not participating or benefiting at desired rates or at the same rates as others? What are other disparities related to the selected program, policy, or process that are known at the outset of the assessment?\nWhat are the information sources for those inequities or disparities?  What is the comparison population or reference point for observed disparities? Reference point options include the total population in an area, the national population, the largest group, or a benchmark chosen through a planning process. Whenever possible, try to think critically about this population rather than simply defaulting to comparison populations used in the past.\nHow might population groups’ identifying characteristics overlap in ways that expose them to relatively greater inequities (known as intersectionality)? What implications does this overlap have for the impacts of the program, policy or process? For example, immigrants who are also LGBTQIA+ might face multiple barriers in accessing a particular program.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the context for observed disparities and the program or policy itself.\n\nWhat is the social and cultural history of the populations listed in Step 1 and how does this history shape their current conditions? How does this context play a role in how these populations might perceive, access, or otherwise interact with the program or policy?\nWhat structural or social drivers of disparities might explain observed disparities? Structural drivers of disparities are governing processes and economic and social policies that distribute power and resources in unfair ways, such as an inequitable distribution of emergency funds to certain communities. Social drivers of disparities are differences in the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, such as poverty, employment, housing, environment quality, transportation, food security, and community safety. Differences in these social conditions drive disparities. Although these conditions are also known as social determinants of health, this tool uses a broader term to encompass multiple outcomes, including both health outcomes and other outcomes (e.g., economic outcomes). Thinking through these drivers of disparities is important for placing focus on systems and institutions that need to be changed, and it helps to avoid blaming groups of people for poor outcomes.\nWhat is known about whether structural, systemic, or institutional racism or structural barriers affect the implementation and outcomes of previous programs or policies? Systemic or institutional racism refers to policies and practices that create or sustain disparate outcomes for persons of different races. An example is redlining, where financial services and other housing-related opportunities were restricted for individuals largely based on their race/ethnicity and originating neighborhoods (see this 2021 Memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development regarding Redressing Our Nation’s and the Federal Government’s History of Discriminatory Housing Practices and Policies)\n\n\n\n\nExperts can include former or current program participants/beneficiaries, members of communities affected by the program, policy, or process, staff who work with program participants/beneficiaries or affected communities, subject matter experts such as researchers, or staff in other organizations, among others. Sources of expert input on programs, policies, and processes include listening sessions, surveys, interviews, focus groups, and position papers by experts in the field or advocacy groups.\n\nHow will the assessment team engage experts with lived experience with relevant programs, policies, processes, and/or issues? To what extent can these experts be part of the assessment team?\nHow will the assessment team engage other experts in the equity assessment (in addition to potentially involving them in the assessment team)? Which experts will be engaged?\nWhat individuals or communities have historically been excluded or disempowered in decision making? How can they be included and meaningfully engaged?\nHow can the assessment team ensure inclusivity when engaging experts, such as translation services or accommodations for people with disabilities? Will there be different options for sharing input for people with different communication preferences or time or transportation constraints?\nHow will the assessment team work to decrease power dynamics and ensure that experts are comfortable providing candid input? How can the team be transparent about how input will be shared and used?\nWhat methods can the assessment team use to collect input, such as focus groups on participants/beneficiaries’ experiences with programs? What are experts’ experiences with current programs and policies, and what are their views on the benefits and burdens involved in participating?\nWhat are experts’ perceptions about barriers to participation? Can experts help the assessment team understand whether there are current or potential burdens or barriers that are more severe for certain population groups?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor more detailed guidance and resources regarding outreach and engagement, see the Practical Guidance Document developed by the Office of Public Participation.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a variety of qualitative and quantitative information sources to support the assessment, including gray and peer-reviewed literature, organization documents and administrative records, surveys, customer inquiry or complaint information, administrative data, program performance data, key informant interviews, and listening sessions or focus groups. Ideally, equity assessments often include both qualitative and quantitative data. Data sources can include, but should not be limited to, expert views.\n\nWhat are the quantitative data sources for the assessment process? Quantitative data such as program, administrative, or survey data shed light on the magnitude and prevalence of an inequity or an opportunity for improvement.\nAre available quantitative data disaggregated by relevant variables, such as race, ethnicity, income, and relevant geographic areas? If not, how can the assessment incorporate data that can help organizations understand or estimate the equity impacts of the program, policy, or process?\nWhat are the qualitative data sources for the assessment process? Qualitative data such as interview or focus group data increase understanding of context, as well as helping to interpret and understand quantitative data.\nAre there gaps or limitations in the information needed for the assessment? If either qualitative or quantitative data are not available, explain why. If there are gaps, how might the assessment team obtain new or better information, or highlight the need for investments in better data? It is important to describe gaps that might reflect historically overlooked inequities or point to the need for information sources that could be developed in future years.\n\n\n\n\nDrawing on all previous steps in the assessment process, analyze the available data and describe equity-related outcomes of the program, policy, or process. Describe findings with as much specificity as possible.\n\nWhat quantitative and qualitative analysis methods did the team use to analyze the available data? Did the team synthesize quantitative and qualitative data to develop a complete picture of current inequities or disparities related to the program, policy, or process?\nWhat are the assessment team’s findings on positive and negative equity-related outcomes of the program, policy, or process? What quantitative and qualitative evidence of inequities exists?\nWhat evidence is there of inequities in areas such as awareness of programs and benefits, processes and rules, administrative burden, access to services, participation, outcomes, quality, and engagement?\nHow do findings change the team’s understanding of disparities related to the selected program, policy, or process known at the outset of the assessment?\nWhat factors might be driving observed inequities or disparities? Are any of those factors potentially caused by the program or policy that is the focus of the assessment?\nHave experts helped the assessment team interpret the available data or validate or refine the initial findings?\nIn what ways might the findings be limited due to data gaps or analysis constraints? What findings point to the need for further research?\n\n\n\n\nDevelop a detailed plan to address inequities identified in Step 5 within the scope of your program.\n\nWhat solutions are needed to resolve observed inequities or disparities, or to address identified drivers of those inequities or disparities? Which solutions are in the program’s sphere of authority?\nWhat are the program’s short-term and long-term goals for improvement? Quantify those goals if possible.\nWhat steps will the program take to accomplish each goal? What coordination, training, information systems changes, business process changes, or other implementation actions are needed?\nHave subject matter experts—including those with lived experience—weighed in on needed solutions, proposed goals, or planned action steps? Are all components of the improvement plan responsive to the needs and cultures of different populations or communities?\nWhat resources will the program need to carry out the improvement plan?\nHas the program consulted or collaborated with key partners on potential improvement options and actions?\nIn what ways could the program coordinate with other partners to achieve equity improvements that are not solely within the control or influence of the program conducting the assessment?\n\nAdditional follow-up actions help programs learn about equity impacts and whether implementation should be adjusted to realize positive outcomes. In addition, equity assessments have the potential to generate many new lessons about equity that could be helpful for other partners. Articulating plans for these actions is part of the equity assessment even though these actions occur after the formal assessment is over.\n\nWould sharing the equity assessment with other partners support collaboration on other policies and programs intended to benefit priority populations?\nWould sharing the equity assessment or a summary of findings with experts who were not directly involved in the assessment further promote equity through transparency and accountability?\nWhat measures or indicators will the program use to track progress over time? Are these disaggregated individual-level or community-level measures? Monitoring can help the program assess whether patterns or trends are in the expected direction or require course corrections.\nHow and when will the organization evaluate the results of potential program changes? Evaluations focus on whether programs or policies reach their goals within a defined period. How can the organization design an equitable and inclusive evaluation?\nWho will be responsible for developing and executing monitoring and evaluation plans?  \nWill the program share monitoring and evaluation results with the experts involved in the assessment or other partners? If so, how?",

    "text": "Background\nDuring its August 18, 2020 meeting, the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) publicly acknowledged that the historical effects of institutional racism must be confronted throughout government, and it directed staff to develop a priority plan of action (Aug 18, 2020 Meeting Agenda, Recording). The State Water Board’s Racial Equity Team held public and employee listening sessions to help develop a draft resolution. After a public comment period on the draft resolution in spring 2021, the Racial Equity Team made significant updates to the resolution. On November 16, 2021, the State Water Board adopted Resolution No. 2021-0050, “Condemning Racism, Xenophobia, Bigotry, and Racial Injustice and Strengthening Commitment to Racial Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Access, and Anti-Racism” (Racial Equity Resolution) which affirms the State Water Board’s commitment to racial equity and directs staff to undertake a variety of actions to achieve racial equity throughout all State Water Board programs and activities (Nov 16, 2021 Meeting Agenda, Recording).\nThe Racial Equity Resolution is one milestone on our ongoing journey to operationalize equity throughout our organization. The next step is to implement the Racial Equity Action Plan, which includes specific actions the State Water Board will take to address racial inequities, as well as metrics to measure our progress. With this Action Plan, we envision a sustainable California where race no longer predicts where clean water is available or who has access to it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity is an outcome\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that racial equity and equity in general is an outcome and there is no such thing as a “racial equity data-set” or “racial equity data”.\nInstead we should think of data as a tool to help us achieve the overall outcome of equity - and how we view, use, and act on data and related tools is what will determine whether we operationalize equity or perpetuate injustice.\n\n\nDevelopment of the Racial Equity Action Plan began in Spring 2022 and involved public and employee engagement and tribal consultations. The Water Boards’ Racial Equity Team presented the Racial Equity Action Plan (2023-2025) to the State Water Board as an informational item at the Board Meeting on January 18, 2023 (Agenda, Slides, Recording).\nGoal 1a of the Racial Equity Action Plan is to ensure Water Boards data are accessible, equitable, and culturally relevant. One action captured under that goal is the development of a Racial Equity Data Action Plan which must: \n\nDevelop training and best practices guidance for Water Boards staff on incorporating racial equity concepts into the planning and design of data collection methods and visualizations (e.g., maps, factsheets, etc.) projects.\nIdentify and expand existing opportunities for public participation in science and community data gathering programs to develop new data collection methods, support existing programs, and incorporate community datasets into the database. \nCreate a publicly accessible data catalog tool / interface that includes existing demographic data, Water Boards program data, and other available data (such as heat maps or flood hazard maps) to inform the implementation of the Racial Equity Action Plan.\n\nThe Racial Equity Data Action Plan is being developed by the Water Board’s Racial Equity Data Subcommittee of the Environmental Justice Roundtable which is a group of volunteer staff from across the Water Board led by the Office of Information Management and Analysis and the Office of Public Participation. This Handbook is intended to address Item 1 above by providing staff a best practices guide for incorporating racial equity concepts into the Water Board programs using data and information. Item 2 above will be iterative and grow as staff and programs begin to utilize the guidance and tools found within this handbook. To fulfill Item 3 above staff have created a California Water Boards Racial Equity Data Resource Hub which will grow as more programs create and publish racial equity based tools and visualizations.",

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nYou should have addressed this during the Plan & Prepare phase of your process…but just in case you haven’t (yet) or you need a refresher - we’re restating here:\nAchieving racial equity outcomes means that race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved (Glossary)\nSo, as you begin to collect the data for your project, be sure it includes:\n\nData that can represent your management question(s) or project objectives.\nData that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes. This may be limited to simple demographics data - but it could also be something more! Working with Tribal and community experts to decide what type(s) of data are most applicable to and reflective of their lived experiences as they relate to your management questions and project objectives is a great place to start!\n\n\n\nThe data related to your project may come from direct human observation, laboratory and field instruments, experiments, simulations, surveys, and/or compilations of data from other sources. Below we focus on data that can be downloaded from open data sources, and survey guidance.\n\n\nIt’s important to remember that ALL data have limits in what they can actually tell us, constraints on how they should be used appropriately, and biases related to initial data collection or generation - and it’s crucial to be aware of and account for them during your project.\nIn most cases, the Water Boards programs were not developed or designed to collect the types of data needed to conduct analyses with an equity lens as a matter of process which means that most will rely on a few key data sources.\n\n\n\nData Benefit vs Risk\n\n\nIncorporating a racial equity lens during data analysis includes incorporating individual, community, political, and historical contexts of race to inform analysis, conclusions, and recommendations. Solely relying on statistical outputs will not necessarily lead to insights without careful consideration during the analytic process, such as ensuring data quality is sufficient and determining appropriate statistical power. Disaggregation of data is also a series of tradeoffs. Without disaggregating data by subgroup, analysis can unintentionally gloss over inequity and lead to invisible experiences. On the other hand, when analysts create a subgroup, they may be shifting the focus of analysis to a specific population that is likely already over-surveilled. (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration)\nCentering racial equity means paying attention to which data are highlighted and how they are framed, as well as the readability and accessibility of the communication method. This involves strategic consideration of the audience and the mode of dissemination that most effectively conveys the information. There are many ways to communicate information. These include briefs, interactive documents, websites, dashboards, social media content, data walks, posters, briefs, and infographics. Regardless of the form, content geared toward the public should avoid jargon that may be otherwise appropriate for internal program staff or academic audiences, while also using person-centered language and translating materials into languages most applicable to your community context. (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration)  \nFurthermore, good quality data regarding marginalized communities is often lacking, but it is still important to discuss impacts to BIPOC communities. It may be appropriate in some cases to still present or analyze this data and also present caveats for the data limitations. In other cases, it may be more appropriate to rely only on qualitative discussion based on information derived from background research and feedback from affected communities.\n\n\n\nBelow we have provided a list of common data sources that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPort over relevant water boards data and databases content?\n\n\n\nUnited States Census Data\nAmerican Community Survey Data\nInternal Administrative Data (i.e. Human Resources data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key to an equity analysis is to compare it to a baseline where race and ethnicity were not factors. Adding demographics data to your data project can help increase understanding of potential correlations or relationships between your data and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of locations of interest.\nDepending on what demographics data sources you decide to use, the methods needed to combine, overlay, or compare with the data you are interested in may vary. Below we outline methods of comparing demographics data to point, line, and polygon data types.\n\n\nIt’s important to remember that you can always benefit from setting context before trying to communicate demographic or specific racial equity answers to questions posed by our Board, a member of the public, or a partner in this work. What your program is about, what does it do, how well does it do these things (aka Performance Report), etc. This may take a few different visualizations to help frame the context of the program mission but will help viewers understand how you are approaching the racial equity data work within the scope of your program. \nOften the go-to resources for making inferences to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics is the National Census dataset and the associated American Community Survey dataset. While we are fortunate to have just updated this dataset in 2020 there are limitations and potential inaccuracies associated with relying solely on census data to enumerate demographic characteristics within a given census tract. This tool from the Department of Finance exists to measure this limitation.\nA detailed example of using R programming to estimate demographics and other characteristics with U.S. census data to be used for custom spatial features is available and can be tailored to programs with the help of a data scientist proficient in R and staff familiar with the program.  https://daltare.github.io/example-census-race-ethnicity-calculation/example_census_race_ethnicity_calculation.html \nExample - SAFER Fund Expenditure Plan\nSection VIII.G. Racial Equity and Environmental Justice provides several tables with data that incorporates demographics data. The tables and the text lack clarity and indepth analysis on why the data is telling the story it is. Race and ethnicity of the populations served by the systems likely isn’t the only only difference between the systems. Are there other factors that are associated with different populations that could be driving the imbalance in failing systems and funding? Perhaps, the majority-Hispanic population systems are much larger, or older, or have more severe problems. An apples to apples comparison would look at the major factors that determine cost and compare the racial difference between those subgroups. For example, comparing the racial and ethnic differences between systems of medium sized cities with a water treatment plant built within the past 30 years. Making these proportions more explicit and adding a section where Hispanics population systems get more funding, proportionally and list some additional explanatory factors that should be explored.\nTIP: It’s ok to note data gaps, and in the case of racial equity data, gaps will be the norm. It is a key part of a good analysis to identify data gaps and set a course for filling those gaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California Water Boards Racial Equity Data Resource Hub provides a list of Water Boards Developed Racial Equity Data Tools\n\n\n\nCalEnviroScreen 4.0\nCalEnviroScreen can be a helpful tool in creating visualizations and performing analysis as it provides a number of index, as well as a “rolled-up” score that combines environmental and demographic data together. However, there can be things to consider, a couple of which are discussed below.\n\n\nUsers conducting an analysis with the CalEnviroScreen (CES) 4.0 dataset should be aware that it contains missing values, both for individual indicators and overall CES scores. These missing values are distinct from zeros, which are also in the CES dataset. For more information about the missing (and zero) values, see the data dictionary (calenviroscreen40resultsdatadictionary_F_2021.pdf) that accompanies the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 results Excel workbook, available for download as a zip file here.\nIn the CES 4.0 data (for the version available as of April 2023), the shapefile containing CES 4.0 scores (available here) encodes these missing values as negative numbers (-999 for most variables, and -1998 for one variable). The Excel workbook containing CES 4.0 scores (available here) encodes these missing values as NA. Users should account for these missing values – and their different encodings – as needed when doing any analysis using CES data. Also, note that the CalEnviroScreen 3 shapefile (June 2018 update version) encoded missing values as 0, so users should be aware of this change if/when updating an analysis from CES 3 to CES 4.0 data.\n\n\n\nIn the CES 4.0 data (for the version available as of April 2023), the shapefile containing CES 4.0 scores (available here) uses a simplified version of the polygons that represent 2010 census tracts. The boundaries of the census tracts defined by these simplified polygons do not always align with the boundaries of neighboring census tracts, resulting in slight gaps or overlaps between some neighboring census tracts. These inconsistencies are not likely to have a significant impact on most uses of the CES data, but they could impact some types of analysis based on CES data. For example, when assessing sites or facilities based on the CES score of the census tract they are located in, sites located near a census tract boundary could be associated with more than one census tract (and more than one CES score) in areas where there are overlapping census tract polygons, or not associated with any census tract (and no CES score) in areas where there are gaps between census tract polygons. This issue may be addressed in a future release of the CES dataset; in the meantime, a possible workaround is to use the official 2010 census tract boundaries from the US Census Bureau for any calculations, then use census tract IDs to tie this information to the associated CES score for each tract.\nCalEnviroScreen vs. EnviroFacts vs. EnviroMapper vs. EJ Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be instances where you need to collect new data using survey(s).\n\n\nCreating surveys that yield actionable insights is all about the details - and writing effective survey questions is the first step. You do not have to be an expert to build and distribute an effective online survey, but by checking your survey against tried-and-tested benchmarks, you can help ensure you are collecting the best data possible.  \nTips for Building an Effective Survey:\n\nMake Sure That Every Question Is Necessary.\nKeep it Short and Simple.\nAsk Direct Questions.\nAsk One Question at a Time.\nAvoid Leading and Biased Questions.\nSpeak Your Respondent’s Language.\nUse Response Scales Whenever Possible.\nAvoid Using Grids or Matrices for Responses.\nRephrase Yes/No Questions if Possible\nTake Your Survey for a Test Drive\n\nA good comprehensive guide for survey design can be found here:  https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED619797.pdf \nhttps://www.qualtrics.com/blog/10-tips-for-building-effective-surveys/\n\n\n\nMost Water Board staff will use Microsoft Forms which is available to all staff through the Microsoft 365 suite of applications.  Microsoft Forms has a lot of advantages because of its integration with other Microsoft tools like Excel and PowerBi which allow for the survey results to be analyzed and visualized.  Here is video on how to make that connection between Forms and PowerBi via Sharepoint that allows for consistent updating of results:  https://youtu.be/XBFVDedwLiY?si=O161oYja-FBhG1W7 \nOne issue with Microsoft Forms and other free software like Google Forms is that they produce wide data in Excel of Google Sheets.  This type of data is more difficult to transform.",

You do not have to be an expert to build and distribute an effective online survey, but by checking your survey against tried-and-tested benchmarks, you can help ensure you are collecting the best data possible.  \nTips for Building an Effective Survey:\n\nMake Sure That Every Question Is Necessary.\nKeep it Short and Simple.\nAsk Direct Questions.\nAsk One Question at a Time.\nAvoid Leading and Biased Questions.\nSpeak Your Respondent’s Language.\nUse Response Scales Whenever Possible.\nAvoid Using Grids or Matrices for Responses.\nRephrase Yes/No Questions if Possible\nTake Your Survey for a Test Drive\n\nA good comprehensive guide for survey design can be found here:  https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED619797.pdf \nhttps://www.qualtrics.com/blog/10-tips-for-building-effective-surveys/\n\n\n\nMost Water Board staff will use Microsoft Forms which is available to all staff through the Microsoft 365 suite of applications.  Microsoft Forms has a lot of advantages because of its integration with other Microsoft tools like Excel and PowerBi which allow for the survey results to be analyzed and visualized.  Here is video on how to make that connection between Forms and PowerBi via Sharepoint that allows for consistent updating of results:  https://youtu.be/XBFVDedwLiY?si=O161oYja-FBhG1W7 \nOne issue with Microsoft Forms and other free software like Google Forms is that they produce wide data in Excel of Google Sheets.  This type of data is more difficult to transform.",

Thisted, Professor Emeritus - Departments of Statistics and Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago\n\n\n“Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”\n— Leo Tolstoy, Russian author known as one of the world’s greatest novelists.\n“Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.”\n— Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at Posit (formerly RStudio)\n\nGood data organization and formatting is the foundation of any data project. Once the data are collected, you will need to process them so they can be used in your analyses or product development steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt’s commonly understood in the data science field that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data (Dasu and Johnson 2003) - expect the same will be true for your project and prepare to invest time and resources accordingly.\n\n\nThe Resources section below links to resources that provide detailed technical guidance on how to process data using data science methods. Here, we discuss the why and how we go about this step with an equity lens.\nWhen we talk about data processing here, we’re referring to the steps required to organize, format, and clean the data so it’s more efficient to use in future steps, and so others can consistently reproduce your steps - - this is commonly referred to as tidying data.\n\n\nFrom a data science lens - Investing the time to properly tidy your data upfront makes the analyses or product development steps much more efficient and reproducible. This will cut down the time it takes in the long term to complete your analysis and product development steps (even if they need to evolve/change over time!), enabling you to spend more time on the actual data, science, management, and equity questions you have for your project (aka the good stuff!).\nFrom an equity lens - having consistent and reproducible data makes it easy for others to replicate your work, which can increase transparency of your process and ultimately help build trust with your partners, the communities impacted by the management decisions associated with your project, and the public at large.\nAdditionally, working from a foundation of tidy data (and using consistent tools) can make it easier for others to collaborate with and contribute to your data project, which generally results in a better product in the end.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re processing your data and making it tidy, think through which data from your sources are applicable to your question(s). Sometimes we don’t have the technical or logistical capacity to keep ALL of the data we are able to collect - so if you are going to remove data at this step, be sure to document WHY you’re removing it in a way that makes it easy for others to easily understand the reasoning behind the data decisions you’re making. Some reasons might include:\n\nData are outside of the geographic scope of the analysis (e.g. we’re focused on a particular region for the project, and we are removing data outside of that region so we can increase loading/analysis speeds)\nFields/columns from source data are not relevant to our analysis for XYZ reasons.\n\nKeep your “raw data raw”. Any aggregation or preliminary analysis of your data should be completed during the analysis phase of the project. Keeping the values and aggregation of the data as they are at this phase increases reproducibility and transparency now and during future steps. Note that this is different from reformatting/restructuring data from wide to long formats, which is a common and very useful part of the data processing/tidying phase.\nYou might be tempted to begin your data quality assessments as you’re looking at the data during this phase, but you’ll actually want to hold off on that for now. You’ll complete your data quality and assurance steps after all of your data have been tidied and you can look at all of your data holistically.\n\n\n\n\nJulia Lowndes and Allison Horst (2020) Tidy Data for reproducibility, efficiency, and collaboration.

However, for those who want to jump to best practices, or who just need a refresher, we have provided them below, with links to pages that have more details, guidance, and resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice\nDescription\nSource\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nIt is helpful to survey a range of existing tools when considering the mapping of “disadvantaged” populations.\nEach presents strengths and weaknesses to consider while keeping in mind that ultimately decisions will be driven by:\n\nStatutory mandates and priorities of each unique program\nData availability, currency, longevity\nLevel of spatial analysis appropriate for the program\nCensus boundary (Tract, Block Group, or Block)\nProject radius (such as a half-mile)\nWatershed\nWalkshed\n\nWeb-based Tools for Identifying Underserved Communities, CNRA\nThis guidance discusses things to consider when evaluating tools and is applicable to work at the water boards too.\n\n\nUsers conducting an analysis with the CalEnviroScreen (CES) 4.0 dataset should be aware that it contains missing values, both for individual indicators and overall CES scores.\nThese missing values are distinct from zeros, which are also in the CES dataset. For more information about the missing (and zero) values, see the data dictionary (calenviroscreen40resultsdatadictionary_F_2021.pdf) that accompanies the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 results Excel workbook, available for download as a zip file here.\nRacial Equity Data Hub, Tools REDAP Resource Hub Draft (ca.gov), 6/2/2023.\nThings to consider when using CalEnviroScreen Scores.\n\n\nUtilizing quantitative and qualitative analyses to identify inequities and response system  effectiveness.\nVarious national level quantitative and quantitative tools exist to develop a continuum of care focusing on racial inequities and homelessness. Quantitative tools examine population data on race and ethnicity and program outcomes data. Qualitative tool include interviewing people with lived experience.\nRacial Equity Data Guidebook from the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness: https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/Racial_Equity_Data_Guidebook.pdf\nInnovative tools when looking at homelessness and race. The tools could be used for other programs.\n\n\nUsing F.A.I.R. data principles\nFour foundational principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability—that serve to guide data producers and publishers in data management and stewarship.\nOriginal principles from 2016 are available here: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618%C2%A0some good documentation on how to operationalize FAIR principles for equity data is available here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01606-w\nData management principles.\n\n\nUsing CARE principles for Indigenous Data governance.\nThe ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’ address concerns related to the people and purpose of data; Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics, and their respective sub-principles. The CARE Principles detail that the use of Indigenous data should result in tangible benefits for Indigenous collectives through inclusive development and innovation, improved governance and citizen engagement, and result in equitable outcomes.\nA good source of information on CARE including the original publication is available here: https://www.gida-global.org/care CARE and FAIR principles can go hand and hand and there is good information on that available here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00892-0\nData governance with a specific lens on tribal data and is applicable to broader groups of underrepresented peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a steward of Water Boards data - and it is not yet made appropriately open and accessible (including thorough documentation and complete metadata!) - you should complete the guidance on the Publish Your Data page before you begin thinking about planning for your project.\n\nBuilding a map (or other data visualization/interpretation tool) before making our own data open and accessible is not the right order. Share the we have first, then build a map or other resource showing what we think is interesting/important using that (and other) data. \n\n\n\n\nThis phase involves conducting an equity assessment (Planning) and developing your data management plan using an equity lens (Data Preparation). Best practices for this phase include:\n\nNot rushing through this phase! We often want to dive straight into “doing something” and taking the time to plan can feel like a waste of time. If done quickly and without using an equity lens, it will be time wasted. Instead, invest the time needed to do this phase well, rather than fast.\nUsing this phase to begin the process of trust and relationship building with Tribes, communities, and other expert partners interested in your project. Maybe it involves some early outreach, putting together an email list, establishing a technical advisory committee, or otherwise co-creating your planning documents with the communities that will be most impacted by the project’s implementation.\nMake the products developed during this phase as open, transparent, and accessible as possible and appropriate. This doesn’t necessarily mean that every single thing should be made public - but it does mean seriously considering what can be made open, to whom, and when.\nUse the best available science while relying on current, generally accepted Agency procedures for conducting risk assessments, economic or other technical analysis.

If done quickly and without using an equity lens, it will be time wasted. Instead, invest the time needed to do this phase well, rather than fast.\nUsing this phase to begin the process of trust and relationship building with Tribes, communities, and other expert partners interested in your project. Maybe it involves some early outreach, putting together an email list, establishing a technical advisory committee, or otherwise co-creating your planning documents with the communities that will be most impacted by the project’s implementation.\nMake the products developed during this phase as open, transparent, and accessible as possible and appropriate. This doesn’t necessarily mean that every single thing should be made public - but it does mean seriously considering what can be made open, to whom, and when.\nUse the best available science while relying on current, generally accepted Agency procedures for conducting risk assessments, economic or other technical analysis.

    "section": "",
    "text": "When working with a racial equity lens we suggest establishing a common language and definitions to cultivate a collective understanding of underlying concepts and historical context. Creating and agreeing upon a common language can help foster transparency, challenge assumptions, and center the voices of marginalized communities; yet the efficiency of these efforts hinges on a shared language that facilitates understanding and collaboration. By grounding discussions in a common language, we can build trust and empower our team and community.\nEstablishing a common language and definitions are critical to creating a shared understanding, however we acknowledge that language can be used deliberately to engage and support community anti-racism coalitions and initiatives, or to inflame and divide them. It is important to note that although the language in this Handbook may be commonly used, the list of terms herein is not exhaustive, and may not be the sole definition of a term, and some may disagree with the definitions and their use. More specifically, in this resource we intentionally use the acronym BIPoC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) as a term that seeks to recognize the unique experience of Black and Indigenous People within the United States. We recognize that naming is power, and we remain committed to using language that supports pro-Blackness and Native visibility, while dismantling white supremacy. \n\n\nBelow are a set of key terms and definitions provided by the Water Board Racial Equity Team in the development of the Racial Equity Resolution and Racial Equity Action Plan and are those that we adhere to in this document. (citations can be found here). For a more comprehensive list of equity-related terms, see the Racial Equity Tools Glossary\n\nDisadvantaged Community (DAC) is defined by the California Water Code as a community in which the median household income (MHI) is less than 80 percent of the statewide annual MHI (CA Water Code Section 13149.2 and 79505.5(a)). At the time this document was developed, the statewide annual MHI from the U.S. Census Bureau from 2017-2021 was $84,097 (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: California). Based on this data, a community with a household income of less than $67,278 qualifies as a DAC based on the Water Code definition.\nEquality describes circumstances in which each individual or group is given the same or equal treatment, including the same resources, opportunities, and support. However, because different individuals or groups have different histories, needs, and circumstances, they do not have equal positions in society or starting points. Providing the same resources, support, or treatment does not guarantee that everyone will have fair or equal outcomes.\nEthnicity is a term used to describe subgroups of a population that share characteristics such as language, values, behavioral patterns, history, and ancestral geographical base. Social scientists often use the terms ethnicity and ethnic group to avoid the perception of biological significance associated with race.\nIntersectionality is a term used to describe the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine, overlap and intersect especially in the experiences of marginalized individuals or groups.\nInstitutional racism describes the ways in which policies and practices perpetuated by institutions, including governments and private groups, produce different outcomes for different racial groups in a manner that benefits the dominant group. In the United States, institutional racism includes policies that may not mention race but still result in benefiting white people over people of color.\nRace is a social construct used to categorize humans into groups based on combinations of shared physical traits such as skin color, hair texture, nose shape, eye shape, or head shape. Although most scientists agree that such groupings lack biological meaning, racial groups continue to have a strong influence over contemporary social relations. Historically in the United States, race has frequently been used to concentrate power with white people and legitimize dominance over non-white people.\nRacial equity means Race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved. For example, when we hold income constant, there are still large inequities based on race across multiple indicators for success, including the environment, education, jobs, incarceration, health and housing. \nRacism is any prejudice against someone because of their race when systems of power reinforce those views. \nStructural racism is the normalization and legitimization of an array of historical, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal dynamics that routinely advantage whites while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for people of color. Structural racism encompasses the entire system of white domination, diffused, and infused in all aspects of society, including its history, culture, politics, economics, and whole social fabric. Structural racism is more difficult to locate in a particular institution because it involves the reinforcing effects of multiple institutions and cultural norms, past and present, continually reproducing old and producing new forms of racism. Structural racism is the most profound and pervasive form of racism; all other forms of racism emerge from structural racism.\nSystemic racism can be said to encompass both institutional and structural racism. Glenn Harris, president of Race Forward, defines systemic racism as “the complex interaction of culture, policy and institutions that holds in place the outcomes we see in our lives.”  The legacy of systemic racism can be seen in a variety of outcomes affecting people of color, such as housing insecurity, a ten-fold wealth gap between white and Black or Latinx households, a dramatic over-representation of people of color in prison, and disparities in education, health, and exposure to environmental pollution.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are a set of common terms that are non-inclusive particularly to Black and Indigenous People and are commonly used in the workplace that have . This is not an exhaustive list but we recommend that research be conducted to review non-inclusive terms that may be used and have a history prior to engaging with communities. A good resource to start with is the University of Arizona’s Antiracist language guide.\n\nBlacklist - Blacklist typically refers to the ostracizing of a person, group, or organization that prevents them from participating in specific activities or spaces. This issue with the word blacklist is the association of the color with negative, evil, or wrong, and the racist undertones associated with it, and can be harmful.\n\nAlternatives: blocked, closed off, inaccessible, blocked list, banned, or closed list\n\nBrown Bag - The term “brown bag” has a historical connotation with creating an exclusive gathering that required attendees to have a lighter skin tone than a brown paper bag to participate and gain access.\n\nAlternatives: lunch in, lunch and learn, presentation, seminar\n\nChief - this term is used throughout the Water Boards to indicate positions and job titles.  This term is appropriated from the Indigenous Peoples of North America and should be avoided wherever possible.\n\nAlternatives: manager, lead, head\n\nGrandfathered in - The American South created absurd voting requirements that targeted Black people and made it almost impossible to vote. The name for these requirements is the “Grandfather Clause.” They wrote the Amendment in a way to imply the practice was not discriminatory. They created stringent new voter requirements such as literacy tests. These requirements did not apply to people who had voted before 1867. Slaves did not know they were free until June 19, 1865. However, slavery was abolished on January 1, 1863, making it nearly impossible for a person formally kept in captivity to be legally allowed to vote.\n\nAlternatives:  legacied, exempted, preapproved\n\nMaster ____ - using the term “master” to describe something that is the main or centralized source of information is inappropriate due to the connotations associated with slavery.\n\nAlternatives: primary, main\n\nPow wow - Social gatherings for ceremonial and celebratory purposes conducted under strict protocols. Avoid using the phrase to refer to a quick business meeting or informal social gathering as this is a form of cultural appropriation.\n\nAlternatives: meeting, gathering, or huddle\n\nSpirit Animal - These are spiritual guides that take the form of animals often viewed as sacred in tribal cultures. Non-native people appropriate the term to relate themselves to an animal, inanimate object, or person and draw parallels between the person and object’s characteristics. For example, saying that a sloth is your spirit animal because you are slow, lazy, and/or sleepy.\n\nAlternatives: patronus, kindred spirit, reason for living, muse, guide, or familiar.\n\nTotem Pole - Pieces of wood carved with a person’s totems. It is a tradition particular to Native and Indigenous people on the Northwest Coast. They tend to convey a family or tribe’s history. Avoid using phrases like “low on the totem pole” or “climbing the totem pole” as these are forms of cultural appropriation. These phrases are also inaccurate because in some First Nation communities being lower on the totem pole is a higher honor.\n\nAlternatives: climbing the corporate ladder, the lowest rung on the latter, least significant, or promotion.\n\nWhite Paper - while this term is widely used to describe an authoritative document, the term has historical implications that evoke negative associations especially with Tribes. \n\nAlternatives: Issue paper, briefing document, prospectus",

    "text": "As you’re in the Planning phase of conducting your Equity Assessment, we recommend documenting what you are doing for the remaining phases of the data life cycle and making that documentation as open and transparent as possible. This is best accomplished through the use of a Data Management Plan.\nA Data Management Plan describes what data will be used, how the data will be collected, processed, and managed to conduct your analysis, visualization or other products, and how those data products will be stored, shared, and maintained over the long-term. In other words, the Data Management Plan describes how the project team intends to address and manage each phase of the data life cycle.\nDepending on the complexity of the project, your data management plan can be relatively short, and it can be used as a way to begin to engage with experts and partners that are interested in your project!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry using the development of your Data Management Plan as a way to build relationships and trust with Tribal and community experts!\nSome ideas for how to do this include:\n\nYou can create a Technical Advisory group composed of Tribal and community experts that helps co-create the Data Management Plan with the Project Team.\nThe Project Team develops the Data Management Plan, but solicits feedback on early versions from Tribal and community experts and makes revisions according to their feedback.\n\n\n\nA Data Management Plan should include the following sections:\n\nProject Introduction & Context\nData Collection & Processing\nData Analysis & Product Development\nData & Product Preservation & Storage\nData & Product Publication & Sharing\nData & Product Documentation\nData & Product Evaluation\nOther Potential Sections or Potential Appendices, including: Acknowledgements, Timeline, Project Roles and Responsibilities, Dataset Details, Survey Details, Future work\n\nSince the development the Data Management Plan takes place before data are actually collected, some details, like specific analytical methods, may not be completely worked out. However, the Data Management Plan should include a clear vision and general plan for each section and include as much detail as possible.\n\n\nHere you want to briefly describe the project and the mechanism(s) driving the data collection and product development. Much of this will likely be worked out during the Planning phase, including:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the selected program, policy, or process, related to this project?\nWhat are the objectives of the project?\nWho is the intended audience of the project?\nHow do you envision the project’s resulting data and products contribute to the advancement and operationalization of equity for your the program, policy, or process, related to this project?\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will identify the data you plan on collecting, how you will collect it, and how you organize, manage, and process said data once it is collected. More detailed guidance on collection and processing of data and resultant products is outlined on the Data Collection, Surveys, and Data Processing pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to pause and think about what you actually need to answer the questions/objectives you have using an equity lens.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder - achieving racial equity outcomes means that race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved (Glossary)\nSo, as you create the list of data you want to collect for your project, it should contain:\n\nData that can represent your management question(s) or project objectives. See the Planning page for more guidance.\nData that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes. This may be limited to simple demographics data - but it could also be something more! Working with Tribal and community experts to decide what type(s) of data are most applicable to and reflective of their lived experiences as they relate to your management questions and project objectives is a great place to start! See the Data Collection page for more guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\nA good plan will include information that is sufficient to understand the nature of the data that is collected, including:\n\nTypes. A good first step is to list the various types of data that you expect to collect or create. This may include text, spreadsheets, software and algorithms, models, images and movies, audio files, and patient records. \nSources. Data may come from direct human observation, laboratory and field instruments, experiments, simulations, surveys, and compilations of data from other studies.\nVolume. Both the total volume of data and the total number of files that are expected to be collected can affect all other data management activities.\nData and file formats. Technology changes and formats that are acceptable today may soon be obsolete. Good choices include those formats that are nonproprietary, based upon open standards, and widely adopted and preferred by the larger data consuming community (e.g., Comma Separated Values [CSV] over Excel [.xls, xlsx]). Data are more accessible for the long term if they are uncompressed, unencrypted, and stored using standard character encodings.\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat data will we be collecting and/or generating?\nHow and in what format will the data be collected? Is it numerical data, image data, text sequences, or modeling data?\nWhat file formats will be used? Do these formats conform to an open standard and/or are they proprietary?\nHow much data will be generated for this project?\nAre you using data that someone else produced? If so, where is it from?\nHow long will the data be collected/generated and how often will it change?\nTo what extent do the data and methods of collection and use for this project abide by FAIR Principles of scientific data management and stewardship and CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance? If FAIR and CARE Principles are not being met - how can we modify our methods and processes data collection and use to better meet them?\n\n\n\n\nFAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) within the open data movement primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) for Indigenous Data Governance are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. Image credit: Global Indigenous Data Allianc\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine how and where the data will be organized and managed.\nFor example, your effort may require a small number of data tables and these can be effectively managed with spreadsheet programs like Excel. Larger data volumes and usage constraints may require the use of relational database management systems for linked data tables like ORACLE or mySQL, or a Geographic Information System (GIS) for geospatial data layers like ArcGIS, or computer programming languages like R or Python for large datasets that cannot be contained within standard database or GIS systems.\nThis section should contain just enough detail to identify basic data organization needs and plan, not the level of detail needed to build a comprehensive system or information technology project plan.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nHow and where will your data be organized?\nWhat tools or software are required to read or view the data?\nWhat directory and file naming convention will be used?\nWhat are your local storage and backup procedures?\nWill this data require secure storage?\nWho is responsible for managing the data? Who will ensure that the data management plan is carried out?\nWhat steps will be taken to protect privacy, security, confidentiality, intellectual property or other rights?\n\n\n\n\nHere you will define the processes you will use to clean and prepare your data once it is collected - also known as tidying data. Tidy data are structured such that the data are easy to manipulate, model, and visualize - and getting data to the point of being tidy is often the most time consuming step of any data-intensive work. More detailed data processing/tidying steps are outlined on the Data Processing page.\nSimilar to the analysis step - you might not know all of the details of how the data will need to be tidied - what’s important for this section is that you think through the potential methods you will need to use to make disparate datasets interoperable and tidy so that they’re of acceptable quality and easy to use for your analysis and product development steps.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhich datasets (if any) will need to be merged/combined to be made useful for your project? If this needs to be done, how will you plan on doing it?\nWhat are your data quality objectives/standards?\nHow will you assess and establish the quality of the data you use?\nWhat rubric will you use to decide which data are kept and which are excluded from future steps?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider how your project aligns with the Water Boards Quality Management System!\n\n\n\nThe Water Boards have a quality management system and overarching Quality Assurance Management Plan. Be sure to review this material to consider how your project falls in that framework, and if more is needed to ensure your all aspects of your project are of sufficient quality. For example, many programs do NOT have Quality Assurance Program Plans, so this may be a step needed to occur to establish data quality objectives, etc.\nIn some cases the Quality Assurance and Data Management plans can be integrated (see this USGS Quality-Assurance and Data-Management Plan as an example)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how you intend on using the data and the general plan or intended workflow you envision for your data analysis and/or product development phase. If you know you will use certain formulas, methods, or software for this step, you will identify them here. More detailed guidance on data analysis and product development steps are outlined on the Data Analysis and Data Visualization pages.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat management questions are you planning on answering or informing with this data and project?\n\nIf operational decision making is the use please identify which performance measures or existing resource allocation planning processes that will be using the data (e.g., assigning inspections to staff, determining priority for compliance assurance work, etc.).\nPlease also identify any business interests that will need to be alerted to the data / products and may have concerns over its quality, etc. For example, invoicing for fees will need to have updated information, etc.\n\nWhat workflow will you use to analyse the data and/or develop the resultant data product?\nWhat data analysis or visualization methods or software will you use?\nWhat product(s) will be developed (e.g. analyses, visualizations, applications, reports, etc.)\nWhat opportunities will Tribal and community partners have to review and provide feedback on the data analysis or product development before it is finalized?\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how and where you plan on preserving and storing data and products once they are developed. More detailed guidance on preservation and storage of data and resultant products is outlined on the Preservation & Storage page.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nHow and where will you store and secure your data and resultant products (code, results, products, visualizations, applications, etc.)?\nWhat privacy and confidentiality issues must you address?\nWhat are your plans for preserving the data/products after the project is completed?\nWhat procedures will you use to ensure long-term archiving and preservation of your data?\nAt what point will data, code/scripts, and resultant products/applications be archived or deleted?\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how and where you plan on publishing, sharing and otherwise making accessibly the project’s data and products once they are developed. More detailed guidance on publishing and sharing data and resultant products is outlined on the Data Sharing page.\nThe Water Boards typically make virtually all of the data we collect available to the public. The exceptions are confidential information (e.g., part of ongoing enforcement actions and/or formal Tribal consultations) and some personally identifiable information (PII). This section should describe any policies that will filter out data from the step of making the data publicly available and, more importantly, how the project plans to provide access to the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake your project as open and accessible as possible and appropriate!\n\n\n\nPublishing and sharing Water Boards data and resultant products is critical for collaboration and transparency of our data, products, and workflows. Your project should be in alignment with the Water Board’s Open Data Resolution: “Adopting Principles of Open Data as a Core Value and Directing Programs and Activities to Implement Strategic Actions to Improve Data Accessibility and Associated Innovation.”\nThis means:\n\nDocumenting your process throughout the project so as to make it open, transparent, and reproducible\nUtilizing open data and open source software (e.g. Python, R) as much as possible\nMaking the data you use and code you develop transparent and accessible to the public after the project is complete, as appropriate\n\n\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat data and products will be shared, and when?\nWhere and how will data and products be made open and/or accessible?\n\nDatasets that are of high value should, at minimum, be published to the California Open Data Portal in the form of machine readable, well documented, maintained data.\nGeospatial products of high value should, at minimum, be published to the California State Geoportal.\nCode and similar products (scripts, analysis packages) should, at minimum, be published on the Water Boards GitHub in it’s own, well documented, project repository.\nFor all other data or products, please indicate how the data/product will be made accessible (e.g., via search forms at SMARTS public reports page, etc.).\n\nDoes sharing the data raise privacy, ethical, or confidentiality concerns?  Do you have a plan to protect or anonymize data, if needed?\nIf you collected data directly from Tribes or communities -\n\nHow will permission be obtained to use and disseminate the data?\nHow is informed consent being handled and how is privacy being protected?\nHow and when will you communicate what will or will not be shared?\n\nTo what extent do the methods of publication and sharing of data, products developed through this project abide by FAIR Principles of scientific data management and stewardship and CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance? If FAIR and CARE Principles are not being met - how can we modify our methods and processes of publication and sharing to better meet them?\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how and where every aspect of the project will be well documented. More detailed guidance on describing the project’s data and products is outlined on the Documentation page.\nMetadata - the details about what, where, when, why, and how the data were collected, processed, and interpreted - provide the information that enables data and files to be discovered, used, and properly cited. Metadata and other project documentation include descriptions of how data and files are named, physically structured, and stored as well as details about the experiments, analytical/visualization methods, project context, and names long-term data/product/project managers/stewards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe utility and longevity of data and products relate directly to how complete and comprehensive the metadata and documentation are.\n\n\n\nThe amount of effort devoted to creating comprehensive metadata and documentation may vary substantially based on the complexity, types, and volume of data/products developed throughout the life of a project - but it’s safe to assume (and plan for) a substantial amount of time and energy will be required to develop adequate metadata and documentation.\n\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat types of metadata will be produced alongside the data?\nWhat metadata standards will be used? Are you using metadata that is standard to your field?\nHow will the metadata be managed and stored?\nWhat other documentation will be developed for the project and associated products (e.g. workflows, standard operating procedures, data or product use or interpretation guidance, etc.)? Where will that be stored? How will it be made accessible and shared?\nIf you collected data or partnered directly from Tribes or communities -\n\nDoes it make sense to have these same partners review and provide feedback on your metadata and documentation materials? Doing so would help ensure that documentation is clear, simple, and accessible to a wide array of audiences.\nWhen and how will you share the aforementioned documentation with your partners?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how you will evaluate the data, products, and outcomes of the project after it is complete, to assess the extent to which the project has achieved the goals you set for it and advanced and improved equity outcomes. More detailed guidance on describing the project’s data and products is outlined on the Evaluation page.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nAt what point(s) during the project’s life cycle will you conduct your evaluation? (You don’t need to wait until the project is complete to benefit from this phase!)\nWhat evaluation method(s) will you use?\nHow can the project design an equitable and inclusive evaluation?\nWill the project team share evaluation findings with the experts or other partners involved in the project? If so, with whom will you share it, and how?\nWould sharing the project’s evaluation findings with the experts or other partners who were NOT directly involved in the project further promote equity through transparency and accountability? If so, with whom will you share it, and how?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Data Management Plan was developed by a group that included external partners, we recommend including an acknowledgements section to acknowledge, express appreciation, and give credit to those efforts.\n\n\n\nIncluding a timeline for project implementation is always recommended (even though it is more of a project management tool than a data management tool) and even if specific dates are not yet known. Including a timeline helps keep oursleves accountable and makes it easier for potential partners see when their contributions, feedback, and partnership might be needed so they can plan ahead and be ready for when its their time to engage.\n\n\n\nIf there are multiple people on the team that will be involved with project implementation, it might be a good idea to define who will be responsible for which parts of the project/data life cycle so that everyone is clear on their roles and responsibilities to this project ( even though it is more of a project management tool than a data management tool).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSpelling out project roles and responsibilities during this phase can help identify gaps and resource needs early!\nThis will enable the project team, management, and/or project partners to understand the limitations and dedicate time and resources to find more team members that can help fill those gaps before the project is underway. Doing this will ultimately prevent the project from being delayed, stalled, or put on hold after time, energy, and resources have already been expended (or even wasted).\n\n\nYou might include a Project Roles and Responsibilities table that includes:\n\nData Life Cycle Phase\nRole Title (e.g. project manager, data collection coordinator, data manager, data analysis lead, data product developer, project engagement lead, etc.)\nName (Affiliation)\nResponsibilities (with a short list of responsibilities associated with that role)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this section is making it easy for readers to see and understand the content of your data sources without having to view data directly. You might include a data schema for the datasets of interest. A data schema shows what the “guts” of your data will look like, including the identification of tables, columns/fields, data types, constraints, and relationships. This could be provided as a single table that includes your column/field names, and data types or something much more complex that better suits the needs of your project. For a simple example, see Appendix 1 of the SWAMP Bioassessment Reporting Module Data Management Plan.\n\n\n\nIf your project involves collecting data through a survey, you might use this section to document your intended survey questions and possible responses or response types.\n\n\n\nHere you might describe next steps or project ideas that are outside the scope and timelines of the current project, but that you see as being directly related to or building upon the current project.\n\n\n\n\n\nDMP Tool (a web-based tool that helps you construct data management plans using templates that address specific funder requirements) \nCA Healthy Watersheds Partnership Assessment Guidance: Data Acquisition, Monitoring and Management\nUSGS - Data Management Plans\nMIT Libraries - Write a Data Management Plan &\nHarvard Medical School - Data Management Plans\nUniversity of Arizona - Data Management Plans Overview",

    "text": "In this section, you will identify the data you plan on collecting, how you will collect it, and how you organize, manage, and process said data once it is collected. More detailed guidance on collection and processing of data and resultant products is outlined on the Data Collection, Surveys, and Data Processing pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to pause and think about what you actually need to answer the questions/objectives you have using an equity lens.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder - achieving racial equity outcomes means that race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved (Glossary)\nSo, as you create the list of data you want to collect for your project, it should contain:\n\nData that can represent your management question(s) or project objectives. See the Planning page for more guidance.\nData that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes. This may be limited to simple demographics data - but it could also be something more! Working with Tribal and community experts to decide what type(s) of data are most applicable to and reflective of their lived experiences as they relate to your management questions and project objectives is a great place to start! See the Data Collection page for more guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\nA good plan will include information that is sufficient to understand the nature of the data that is collected, including:\n\nTypes. A good first step is to list the various types of data that you expect to collect or create. This may include text, spreadsheets, software and algorithms, models, images and movies, audio files, and patient records. \nSources. Data may come from direct human observation, laboratory and field instruments, experiments, simulations, surveys, and compilations of data from other studies.\nVolume. Both the total volume of data and the total number of files that are expected to be collected can affect all other data management activities.\nData and file formats. Technology changes and formats that are acceptable today may soon be obsolete. Good choices include those formats that are nonproprietary, based upon open standards, and widely adopted and preferred by the larger data consuming community (e.g., Comma Separated Values [CSV] over Excel [.xls, xlsx]). Data are more accessible for the long term if they are uncompressed, unencrypted, and stored using standard character encodings.\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat data will we be collecting and/or generating?\nHow and in what format will the data be collected? Is it numerical data, image data, text sequences, or modeling data?\nWhat file formats will be used? Do these formats conform to an open standard and/or are they proprietary?\nHow much data will be generated for this project?\nAre you using data that someone else produced? If so, where is it from?\nHow long will the data be collected/generated and how often will it change?\nTo what extent do the data and methods of collection and use for this project abide by FAIR Principles of scientific data management and stewardship and CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance? If FAIR and CARE Principles are not being met - how can we modify our methods and processes data collection and use to better meet them?\n\n\n\n\nFAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) within the open data movement primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) for Indigenous Data Governance are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. Image credit: Global Indigenous Data Allianc\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine how and where the data will be organized and managed.\nFor example, your effort may require a small number of data tables and these can be effectively managed with spreadsheet programs like Excel. Larger data volumes and usage constraints may require the use of relational database management systems for linked data tables like ORACLE or mySQL, or a Geographic Information System (GIS) for geospatial data layers like ArcGIS, or computer programming languages like R or Python for large datasets that cannot be contained within standard database or GIS systems.\nThis section should contain just enough detail to identify basic data organization needs and plan, not the level of detail needed to build a comprehensive system or information technology project plan.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nHow and where will your data be organized?\nWhat tools or software are required to read or view the data?\nWhat directory and file naming convention will be used?\nWhat are your local storage and backup procedures?\nWill this data require secure storage?\nWho is responsible for managing the data? Who will ensure that the data management plan is carried out?\nWhat steps will be taken to protect privacy, security, confidentiality, intellectual property or other rights?\n\n\n\n\nHere you will define the processes you will use to clean and prepare your data once it is collected - also known as tidying data. Tidy data are structured such that the data are easy to manipulate, model, and visualize - and getting data to the point of being tidy is often the most time consuming step of any data-intensive work. More detailed data processing/tidying steps are outlined on the Data Processing page.\nSimilar to the analysis step - you might not know all of the details of how the data will need to be tidied - what’s important for this section is that you think through the potential methods you will need to use to make disparate datasets interoperable and tidy so that they’re of acceptable quality and easy to use for your analysis and product development steps.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhich datasets (if any) will need to be merged/combined to be made useful for your project? If this needs to be done, how will you plan on doing it?\nWhat are your data quality objectives/standards?\nHow will you assess and establish the quality of the data you use?\nWhat rubric will you use to decide which data are kept and which are excluded from future steps?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider how your project aligns with the Water Boards Quality Management System!\n\n\n\nThe Water Boards have a quality management system and overarching Quality Assurance Management Plan. Be sure to review this material to consider how your project falls in that framework, and if more is needed to ensure your all aspects of your project are of sufficient quality. For example, many programs do NOT have Quality Assurance Program Plans, so this may be a step needed to occur to establish data quality objectives, etc.\nIn some cases the Quality Assurance and Data Management plans can be integrated (see this USGS Quality-Assurance and Data-Management Plan as an example)",

A quality system is a structured system that describes the policies and procedures for ensuring that work processes, products, or services satisfy the user’s specifications and expectations. A quality system is the means by which an organization manages its quality aspects. These aspects are Project Management, Data Generation and Acquisition, and Assessment and Oversight.\n\nQuality Assurance (QA) involves an integrated system of management activities that involves planning, implementation, documentation, assessment, reporting, and quality improvement to ensure that a process, item, or service is of the type and quality required for the project needs.\nQuality Control (QC) involves a system of technical activities that measures the attributes and performance of a process, item, or service against defined standards to verify that they meet the stated requirements established by the customer. QC also involves analytical frequency requirements and control limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to set up your quality system early!\n\n\n\nImpactful and effective quality assurance requires setting up systems and thinking about quality long before the data analysis phase - be sure to start thinking about project and data quality early and take the time to get effective systems in place.

    "text": "According to the Water Boards Quality Assurance/Quality Control Website:\n\nQuality assurance and quality control are components of a quality system. A quality system is a structured system that describes the policies and procedures for ensuring that work processes, products, or services satisfy the user’s specifications and expectations. A quality system is the means by which an organization manages its quality aspects. These aspects are Project Management, Data Generation and Acquisition, and Assessment and Oversight.\n\nQuality Assurance (QA) involves an integrated system of management activities that involves planning, implementation, documentation, assessment, reporting, and quality improvement to ensure that a process, item, or service is of the type and quality required for the project needs.\nQuality Control (QC) involves a system of technical activities that measures the attributes and performance of a process, item, or service against defined standards to verify that they meet the stated requirements established by the customer. QC also involves analytical frequency requirements and control limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to set up your quality system early!\n\n\n\nImpactful and effective quality assurance requires setting up systems and thinking about quality long before the data analysis phase - be sure to start thinking about project and data quality early and take the time to get effective systems in place.
