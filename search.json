    "text": "Welcome!\nThis is an online user manual for the California Water Board’s Tribal Water Data Map (map), written by the California State Water Resources Control Board’s (State Water Board) Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA).\nThe purpose of the map is to increase awareness of access to the Water Board’s water data initiatives which intersect with Tribal matters and needs. The interactive map includes curated data that have been requested by and useful for California Native American Tribes (tribes).\nThe purpose of this User Manual is to provide guidance and context so it’s easier for all audiences to use the map. Content in this user manual includes curated information that members of the OIMA and our tribal partners have found helpful in using the map.\nThis Quarto book is an open, living, and continuously iterating resource. If you have suggestions for additions or revisions you think should be incorporated into this book, please follow the guidance provided in the Contributing chapter."
