    "text": "During its August 18, 2020 meeting, the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) publicly acknowledged that the historical effects of institutional racism must be confronted throughout government, and it directed staff to develop a priority plan of action. The State Water Board’s Racial Equity Team held public and employee listening sessions to help develop a draft resolution. After a public comment period on the draft resolution in spring 2021, the Racial Equity Team made significant updates to the resolution. On November 16, 2021, the State Water Board adopted Resolution No. 2021-0050, “Condemning Racism, Xenophobia, Bigotry, and Racial Injustice and Strengthening Commitment to Racial Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Access, and Anti-Racism” (Racial Equity Resolution) which affirms the State Water Board’s commitment to racial equity and directs staff to undertake a variety of actions to achieve racial equity throughout all State Water Board programs and activities.  The resolution was one milestone on our ongoing journey; the next step is to implement the Racial Equity Action Plan, which includes specific actions the State Water Board will take to address racial inequities, as well as metrics to measure our progress. With this action plan, we envision a sustainable California where race no longer predicts where clean water is available or who has access to it.  It’s important to note that racial equity and equity in general is an outcome and there is no such thing as a racial equity data-set, instead we should think of data as a tool to help us achieve the overall outcome of equity.\nGoal 1a of the Racial Equity Action Plan is to ensure Water Boards data are accessible, equitable, and culturally relevant.  One action captured under that goal is the development of a Racial Equity Data Action Plan which must: \n\nDevelop training and best practices guidance for Water Boards staff on incorporating racial equity concepts into the planning and design of data collection methods and visualizations (e.g., maps, factsheets, etc.) projects.\nIdentify and expand existing opportunities for public participation in science and community data gathering programs to develop new data collection methods, support existing programs, and incorporate community datasets into the database. \nCreate a publicly accessible data catalog tool / interface that includes existing demographic data, Water Boards program data, and other available data (such as heat maps or flood hazard maps) to inform the implementation of the Racial Equity Action Plan.\n\nThe Racial Equity Data Action Plan is being developed by the Water Board’s Racial Equity Data Task Force which is a group of volunteer staff from across the Water Board led by the Office of Information Management and Office of Public Participation.  This document is intended to address Item 1 above by providing staff a best practices guide for incorporating racial equity concepts into the Water Board programs using data and information.  Item 2 above will be iterative and grow as staff and programs begin to utilize the guidance and tools found within this handbook. To fulfill Item 3 above staff have created a California Water Boards Racial Equity Data Resource Hub which will grow as more programs create and publish racial equity based tools and visualizations.\nIt’s important to note that while this document focuses on data collection, data analysis, and data communication, the long term goal for the State Water Board should be centering on racial equity throughout the Data Life Cycle.  A depiction of the Data Life Cycle is provided below for context.  That means we must have meaningful engagement with our diverse communities especially those that have been historically underserved namely Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC).  If we focus on uplifting those most highly impacted we will inevitably improve the experience for all communities.\n\n\n\nGraphic of the data life cycle.",

To initiate a consultation with the Racial Equity Data Team, please send an email to equitydatahelp@waterboards.ca.gov. \nThis Best Practices and Guidance handbook is a blend of emerging, comprehensive guidance on:  \n\nHow to break down the management questions where racial equity information is being posed against administrative data; and \n\n\n\nHow to apply best practices on data use, data visualization and storytelling to begin an iterative process into Advancing Racial Equity. \n\nThis resource is specifically structured to support Water Boards staff on incorporating racial equity concepts into the planning and design of data collection methods and visualizations (e.g., maps, factsheets, etc.) projects. The guidance and best practices provided serves as a strategic guide emphasizing the importance of collection, analysis and utilization of racial equity data.\nThese users could include: \n\nProgram Staff\nProgram managers\nExecutives\nAgency Partners\nTribal Governments\nThe Public \n\nFurthermore, we strongly suggest staff review the following framework outlined by the Government Alliance for Racial Equity (GARE) to normalize, organize, and operationalize racial equity throughout data integration (see image below). In addition to why it is important to lead with race:\n\n“with the recognition that the creation and perpetuation of racial inequities has been baked into government, and that racial inequities across all indicators for success are deep and pervasive. We also know that other groups of people are still marginalized, including based on gender, sexual orientation, ability and age, to name but a few. Focusing on racial equity provides the opportunity to introduce a framework, tools and resources that can also be applied to other areas of marginalization.It is critical to address all areas of marginalization, and an institutional approach is necessary across the board. As the local and regional government deepens its ability to eliminate racial inequity, it will be better equipped to transform systems and institutions impacting other marginalized groups.”\n\n\n\n\nGARE model of change. Source: GARE Communications Guide, May 2018\n\n\nFurthermore, we recommend staff take the Advancing Racial Equity training series offered by the Water Boards Training Academy to foster a consistent baseline knowledge of racial equity work and the importance of applying a racial equity lens to our work.\nIn summary, before embarking on your racial equity analysis or data project you should:\n\nConsultRacial Equity Data Subcommittee by emailing equitydatahelp@waterboards.ca.gov to help identify audience and potential questions or information your teams’ analysis may answer and provide guidance.\nReview the Racial Equity Data Project Guidance and answer the questions found within the Project Scoping section by filling out this form: https://forms.office.com/g/0HuJqQkiJs \nReview GARE Framework: Normalize, Organize, and Operationalize  \nIf possible, take the Advancing Racial Equity training series offered by the Water Boards Training Academy\n\n\nA running list of Water Board specific racial equity resources are available on Environmental Justice Roundtable SharePoint",

    "title": "4  Establishing Common Language",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When working with racial equity data we suggest establishing a common language and definitions to cultivate a collective understanding of underlying concepts and historical context. Creating and agreeing upon a common language can help foster transparency, challenge assumptions, and center the voices of marginalized communities. Yet the efficiency of these efforts hinges on a shared language that facilitates understanding and collaboration. By grounding discussions in a common language, we can build trust and empower our team and community.\n\nEstablishing a common language and definitions are critical to creating a shared understanding, however we acknowledge that language can be used deliberately to engage and support community anti-racism coalitions and initiatives, or to inflame and divide them. It is important to note that although the language in this resource may be commonly used, it is not the sole definition and some may disagree with the definitions and their use. More specifically, in this resource we intentionally use the acronym BIPoC (Black, Indigenous, people of color) as a term that seeks to recognize the unique experience of Black and Indigenous People within the United States. We recognize that naming is power, and we remain committed to using language that supports pro-Blackness and Native visibility, while dismantling white supremacy. \n\nList of definitions: \nShort list of important definitions (i.e. data definitions and we can address BIPOC here)\nGlossary | Racial Equity Tools - include glossary of definitions? \nBelow are a set of definitions provided by the Water Board Racial Equity Team in the development of the Racial Equity Resolution and Racial Equity Action Plan and are those that we adhere to in this document. (citations can be found here)\n\nEquality describes circumstances in which each individual or group is given the same or equal treatment, including the same resources, opportunities, and support. However, because different individuals or groups have different histories, needs, and circumstances, they do not have equal positions in society or starting points. Providing the same resources, support, or treatment does not guarantee that everyone will have fair or equal outcomes.\nEthnicity is a term used to describe subgroups of a population that share characteristics such as language, values, behavioral patterns, history, and ancestral geographical base. Social scientists often use the terms ethnicity and ethnic group to avoid the perception of biological significance associated with race.\nInstitutional racism describes the ways in which policies and practices perpetuated by institutions, including governments and private groups, produce different outcomes for different racial groups in a manner that benefits the dominant group. In the United States, institutional racism includes policies that may not mention race but still result in benefiting white people over people of color.\nRace is a social construct used to categorize humans into groups based on combinations of shared physical traits such as skin color, hair texture, nose shape, eye shape, or head shape. Although most scientists agree that such groupings lack biological meaning, racial groups continue to have a strong influence over contemporary social relations. Historically in the United States, race has frequently been used to concentrate power with white people and legitimize dominance over non-white people.\nRacial equity means Race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved. For example, when we hold income constant, there are still large inequities based on race across multiple indicators for success, including the environment, education, jobs, incarceration, health and housing. \nRacism is any prejudice against someone because of their race when systems of power reinforce those views. \nStructural racism is the normalization and legitimization of an array of historical, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal dynamics that routinely advantage whites while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for people of color. Structural racism encompasses the entire system of white domination, diffused, and infused in all aspects of society, including its history, culture, politics, economics, and whole social fabric. Structural racism is more difficult to locate in a particular institution because it involves the reinforcing effects of multiple institutions and cultural norms, past and present, continually reproducing old and producing new forms of racism. Structural racism is the most profound and pervasive form of racism; all other forms of racism emerge from structural racism.\n\nSystemic racism can be said to encompass both institutional and structural racism. Glenn Harris, president of Race Forward, defines systemic racism as “the complex interaction of culture, policy and institutions that holds in place the outcomes we see in our lives.”  The legacy of systemic racism can be seen in a variety of outcomes affecting people of color, such as housing insecurity, a ten-fold wealth gap between white and Black or Latinx households, a dramatic over-representation of people of color in prison, and disparities in education, health, and exposure to environmental pollution.\nNon-Inclusive Terms to Avoid:\n\n“Brown Bag” - The term “brown bag” has a historical connotation with creating an exclusive gathering that required attendees to have a lighter skin tone than a brown paper bag to participate and gain access.\n\nAlternatives: lunch in, lunch and learn\n\n“Chief” - this term is used throughout the Water Boards to indicate positions and job titles.  This term is appropriated from the Indigenous Peoples of North America and should be avoided wherever possible.\n\nAlternatives: manager, lead, head\n\n“Grandfathered in” - The American South created absurd voting requirements that targeted Black people and made it almost impossible to vote. The name for these requirements is the “Grandfather Clause.” They wrote the Amendment in a way to imply the practice was not discriminatory. They created stringent new voter requirements such as literacy tests. These requirements did not apply to people who had voted before 1867. Slaves did not know they were free until June 19, 1865. However, slavery was abolished on January 1, 1863, making it nearly impossible for a person formally kept in captivity to be legally allowed to vote.\n\nAlternatives:  legacied, exempted, preapproved\n\n“Master ____” - using the term Master to describe something that is the main or centralized source of information like a PowerPoint presentation or slide deck is inappropriate due to the connotations associated with slavery.\n\nAlternatives: primary, main\n\n“White Paper” - while this term is widely used to describe an authoritative document, the term has historical implications that evoke negative associations especially with Tribes. \n\nAlternatives: Issue paper, briefing document, prospectus",

    "text": "In most cases, the Water Boards programs were not developed or designed to collect demographic data as a matter of process which means that most will rely on a few key data sources.\n\n\n\nData Benefit vs Risk\n\n\nIncorporating a racial equity lens during data analysis includes incorporating individual, community, political, and historical contexts of race to inform analysis, conclusions, and recommendations. Solely relying on statistical outputs will not necessarily lead to insights without careful consideration during the analytic process, such as ensuring data quality is sufficient and determining appropriate statistical power. Disaggregation of data is also a series of tradeoffs. Without disaggregating data by subgroup, analysis can unintentionally gloss over inequity and lead to invisible experiences. On the other hand, when analysts create a subgroup, they may be shifting the focus of analysis to a specific population that is likely already over-surveilled. (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration)\nCentering racial equity means paying attention to which data are highlighted and how they are framed, as well as the readability and accessibility of the communication method. This involves strategic consideration of the audience and the mode of dissemination that most effectively conveys the information. There are many ways to communicate information. These include briefs, interactive documents, websites, dashboards, social media content, data walks, posters, briefs, and infographics. Regardless of the form, content geared toward the public should avoid jargon that may be otherwise appropriate for internal program staff or academic audiences, while also using person-centered language and translating materials into languages most applicable to your community context. (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration)  \nFurthermore, good quality data regarding marginalized communities is often lacking, but it is still important to discuss impacts to BIPOC communities. It may be appropriate in some cases to still present or analyze this data and also present caveats for the data limitations. In other cases, it may be more appropriate to rely only on qualitative discussion based on information derived from background research and feedback from affected communities.",

The boundaries of the census tracts defined by these simplified polygons do not always align with the boundaries of neighboring census tracts, resulting in slight gaps or overlaps between some neighboring census tracts. These inconsistencies are not likely to have a significant impact on most uses of the CES data, but they could impact some types of analysis based on CES data. For example, when assessing sites or facilities based on the CES score of the census tract they are located in, sites located near a census tract boundary could be associated with more than one census tract (and more than one CES score) in areas where there are overlapping census tract polygons, or not associated with any census tract (and no CES score) in areas where there are gaps between census tract polygons. This issue may be addressed in a future release of the CES dataset; in the meantime, a possible workaround is to use the official 2010 census tract boundaries from the US Census Bureau for any calculations, then use census tract IDs to tie this information to the associated CES score for each tract.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Turning data into information in the context of racial equity involved navigating complex ethical considerations. The process requires an understanding of the potential impact on Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) communities and the responsibility to mitigate perpetuating or reinforcing biases. Upholding ethical standards requires a commitment to maintaining privacy, accessibility, and fostering transparency throughout the data transformation process. Additionally, acknowledging the limitations of the data and being transparent about potential biases is essential for maintaining the integrity of the data and information generated and shared. The transformation of racial equity data into meaningful information requires a thoughtful and intentional approach which we will highlight in the next sections.\nFor example, many programs will rely on demographic and socioeconomic data, like those collected from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). Because the ACS is based on a sample, rather than all housing units and people, ACS estimates have a degree of uncertainty associated with them, called sampling error. In general, the larger the sample, the smaller the level of sampling error. To help users understand the impact of sampling error on data reliability, the Census Bureau provides a “margin of error” for each published ACS estimate. The margin of error, combined with the ACS estimate, gives users a range of values within which the actual “real-world” value is likely to fall.  It is important to acknowledge this uncertainty up front to be transparent with your audience about the data and conclusions you are drawing.  For more information on using ACS data please see the Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know Handbook.  Also for an interactive tool that measures the potential inaccuracies associated with relying on census data to enumerate demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in California please explore: https://cacensus.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=48be59de0ba94a3dacff1c9116df8b37.\n\nAnother example of how to tell your data story in a transparent way can be found on the Office of Environmental Health and Hazard Assessment CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Race and Equity Analysis.  https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f555670d30a942e4b46b18293e2795a7",

While we are fortunate to have just updated this dataset in 2020 there are limitations and potential inaccuracies associated with relying solely on census data to enumerate demographic characteristics within a given census tract. A tool from the Department of Finance exists to measure this limitation and is available here https://cacensus.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=48be59de0ba94a3dacff1c9116df8b37.\nA detailed example of using R programming to estimate demographics and other characteristics with U.S. census data to be used for custom spatial features is available and can be tailored to programs with the help of a data scientist proficient in R and staff familiar with the program.  https://daltare.github.io/example-census-race-ethnicity-calculation/example_census_race_ethnicity_calculation.html.",
