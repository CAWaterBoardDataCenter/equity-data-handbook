    "text": "Welcome!\nThis Equity Data Handbook is an online resource written by the The State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards), collectively known as the California Water Boards (Water Boards).\nContent in this Handbook includes best practices and guidance for Water Boards staff on incorporating racial equity concepts into their data-related work. Specifically, this Handbook will provide guidance and resources to help Water Boards staff conduct each phase of the data life cycle through a racial equity lens - from the planning and design of a project to data collection methods, visualization development (e.g., maps, fact sheets, etc.) and more!\nA depiction of the Data Life Cycle is provided below for context. We must have meaningful engagement and partnership with our diverse communities during each phase of the Data Life Cycle, especially those that have been historically underserved namely Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC). If we focus on uplifting those most highly impacted we will inevitably improve the the data products and services we develop and, most importantly, the experiences and outcomes for all communities.\n\n\n\nGraphic of the data life cycle.\n\n\nThis Quarto book is an open, living, and continuously iterating resource.

    "text": "During its August 18, 2020 meeting, the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) publicly acknowledged that the historical effects of institutional racism must be confronted throughout government, and it directed staff to develop a priority plan of action (Aug 18, 2020 Meeting Agenda, Recording). The State Water Board’s Racial Equity Team held public and employee listening sessions to help develop a draft resolution. After a public comment period on the draft resolution in spring 2021, the Racial Equity Team made significant updates to the resolution. On November 16, 2021, the State Water Board adopted Resolution No. 2021-0050, “Condemning Racism, Xenophobia, Bigotry, and Racial Injustice and Strengthening Commitment to Racial Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Access, and Anti-Racism” (Racial Equity Resolution) which affirms the State Water Board’s commitment to racial equity and directs staff to undertake a variety of actions to achieve racial equity throughout all State Water Board programs and activities (Nov 16, 2021 Meeting Agenda, Recording).\nThe Racial Equity Resolution is one milestone on our ongoing journey to operationalize equity throughout our organization. The next step is to implement the Racial Equity Action Plan, which includes specific actions the State Water Board will take to address racial inequities, as well as metrics to measure our progress. With this Action Plan, we envision a sustainable California where race no longer predicts where clean water is available or who has access to it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that racial equity and equity in general is an outcome and there is no such thing as a “racial equity data-set” or “racial equity data”.\nInstead we should think of data as a tool to help us achieve the overall outcome of equity - and how we view, use, and act on data and related tools is what will determine whether we operationalize equity or perpetuate injustice.\n\n\nDevelopment of the Racial Equity Action Plan began in Spring 2022 and involved public and employee engagement and tribal consultations. The Water Boards’ Racial Equity Team presented the Racial Equity Action Plan (2023-2025) to the State Water Board as an informational item at the Board Meeting on January 18, 2023 (Agenda, Slides, Recording).\nGoal 1a of the Racial Equity Action Plan is to ensure Water Boards data are accessible, equitable, and culturally relevant. One action captured under that goal is the development of a Racial Equity Data Action Plan which must: \n\nDevelop training and best practices guidance for Water Boards staff on incorporating racial equity concepts into the planning and design of data collection methods and visualizations (e.g., maps, factsheets, etc.) projects.\nIdentify and expand existing opportunities for public participation in science and community data gathering programs to develop new data collection methods, support existing programs, and incorporate community datasets into the database. \nCreate a publicly accessible data catalog tool / interface that includes existing demographic data, Water Boards program data, and other available data (such as heat maps or flood hazard maps) to inform the implementation of the Racial Equity Action Plan.\n\nThe Racial Equity Data Action Plan is being developed by the Water Board’s Racial Equity Data Subcommittee of the Environmental Justice Roundtable which is a group of volunteer staff from across the Water Board led by the Office of Information Management and Analysis and the Office of Public Participation. This Handbook is intended to address Item 1 above by providing staff a best practices guide for incorporating racial equity concepts into the Water Board programs using data and information. Item 2 above will be iterative and grow as staff and programs begin to utilize the guidance and tools found within this handbook. To fulfill Item 3 above staff have created a California Water Boards Racial Equity Data Resource Hub which will grow as more programs create and publish racial equity based tools and visualizations.",

We also know that other groups of people are still marginalized, including based on gender, sexual orientation, ability and age, to name but a few. Focusing on racial equity provides the opportunity to introduce a framework, tools and resources that can also be applied to other areas of marginalization.It is critical to address all areas of marginalization, and an institutional approach is necessary across the board. As the local and regional government deepens its ability to eliminate racial inequity, it will be better equipped to transform systems and institutions impacting other marginalized groups.”",

    "text": "Equality describes circumstances in which each individual or group is given the same or equal treatment, including the same resources, opportunities, and support. However, because different individuals or groups have different histories, needs, and circumstances, they do not have equal positions in society or starting points. Providing the same resources, support, or treatment does not guarantee that everyone will have fair or equal outcomes.\nEthnicity is a term used to describe subgroups of a population that share characteristics such as language, values, behavioral patterns, history, and ancestral geographical base. Social scientists often use the terms ethnicity and ethnic group to avoid the perception of biological significance associated with race.\nInstitutional racism describes the ways in which policies and practices perpetuated by institutions, including governments and private groups, produce different outcomes for different racial groups in a manner that benefits the dominant group. In the United States, institutional racism includes policies that may not mention race but still result in benefiting white people over people of color.\nRace is a social construct used to categorize humans into groups based on combinations of shared physical traits such as skin color, hair texture, nose shape, eye shape, or head shape. Although most scientists agree that such groupings lack biological meaning, racial groups continue to have a strong influence over contemporary social relations. Historically in the United States, race has frequently been used to concentrate power with white people and legitimize dominance over non-white people.\nRacial equity means Race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved. For example, when we hold income constant, there are still large inequities based on race across multiple indicators for success, including the environment, education, jobs, incarceration, health and housing. \nRacism is any prejudice against someone because of their race when systems of power reinforce those views. \nStructural racism is the normalization and legitimization of an array of historical, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal dynamics that routinely advantage whites while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for people of color. Structural racism encompasses the entire system of white domination, diffused, and infused in all aspects of society, including its history, culture, politics, economics, and whole social fabric. Structural racism is more difficult to locate in a particular institution because it involves the reinforcing effects of multiple institutions and cultural norms, past and present, continually reproducing old and producing new forms of racism. Structural racism is the most profound and pervasive form of racism; all other forms of racism emerge from structural racism.\nSystemic racism can be said to encompass both institutional and structural racism. Glenn Harris, president of Race Forward, defines systemic racism as “the complex interaction of culture, policy and institutions that holds in place the outcomes we see in our lives.”  The legacy of systemic racism can be seen in a variety of outcomes affecting people of color, such as housing insecurity, a ten-fold wealth gap between white and Black or Latinx households, a dramatic over-representation of people of color in prison, and disparities in education, health, and exposure to environmental pollution.",

How does this context play a role in how these populations might perceive, access, or otherwise interact with the program or policy?\nWhat structural or social drivers of disparities might explain observed disparities? Structural drivers of disparities are governing processes and economic and social policies that distribute power and resources in unfair ways, such as an inequitable distribution of emergency funds to certain communities. Social drivers of disparities are differences in the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, such as poverty, employment, housing, environment quality, transportation, food security, and community safety. Differences in these social conditions drive disparities. Although these conditions are also known as social determinants of health, this tool uses a broader term to encompass multiple outcomes, including both health outcomes and other outcomes (e.g., economic outcomes). Thinking through these drivers of disparities is important for placing focus on systems and institutions that need to be changed, and it helps to avoid blaming groups of people for poor outcomes.\nWhat is known about whether structural, systemic, or institutional racism or structural barriers affect the implementation and outcomes of previous programs or policies? Systemic or institutional racism refers to policies and practices that create or sustain disparate outcomes for persons of different races. An example is redlining, where financial services and other housing-related opportunities were restricted for individuals largely based on their race/ethnicity and originating neighborhoods (see this 2021 Memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development regarding Redressing Our Nation’s and the Federal Government’s History of Discriminatory Housing Practices and Policies)",

    "text": "5.5 Step 4. Identify information sources and gaps\nConsider a variety of qualitative and quantitative information sources to support the assessment, including gray and peer-reviewed literature, organization documents and administrative records, surveys, customer inquiry or complaint information, administrative data, program performance data, key informant interviews, and listening sessions or focus groups. Ideally, equity assessments often include both qualitative and quantitative data. Data sources can include, but should not be limited to, expert views.\n\nWhat are the quantitative data sources for the assessment process? Quantitative data such as program, administrative, or survey data shed light on the magnitude and prevalence of an inequity or an opportunity for improvement.\nAre available quantitative data disaggregated by relevant variables, such as race, ethnicity, income, and relevant geographic areas? If not, how can the assessment incorporate data that can help organizations understand or estimate the equity impacts of the program, policy, or process?\nWhat are the qualitative data sources for the assessment process? Qualitative data such as interview or focus group data increase understanding of context, as well as helping to interpret and understand quantitative data.\nAre there gaps or limitations in the information needed for the assessment? If either qualitative or quantitative data are not available, explain why. If there are gaps, how might the assessment team obtain new or better information, or highlight the need for investments in better data? It is important to describe gaps that might reflect historically overlooked inequities or point to the need for information sources that could be developed in future years.",

Are all components of the improvement plan responsive to the needs and cultures of different populations or communities?\nWhat resources will the program need to carry out the improvement plan?\nHas the program consulted or collaborated with key partners on potential improvement options and actions?\nIn what ways could the program coordinate with other partners to achieve equity improvements that are not solely within the control or influence of the program conducting the assessment?\n\nAdditional follow-up actions help programs learn about equity impacts and whether implementation should be adjusted to realize positive outcomes. In addition, equity assessments have the potential to generate many new lessons about equity that could be helpful for other partners. Articulating plans for these actions is part of the equity assessment even though these actions occur after the formal assessment is over.\n\nWould sharing the equity assessment with other partners support collaboration on other policies and programs intended to benefit priority populations?\nWould sharing the equity assessment or a summary of findings with experts who were not directly involved in the assessment further promote equity through transparency and accountability?\nWhat measures or indicators will the program use to track progress over time? Are these disaggregated individual-level or community-level measures? Monitoring can help the program assess whether patterns or trends are in the expected direction or require course corrections.\nHow and when will the organization evaluate the results of potential program changes?

    "text": "6.2 Data Collection & Processing\nIn this section, you will identify the data you plan on collecting, how you will collect it, and how you organize, manage, and process said data once it is collected. More detailed guidance on collection and processing of data and resultant products is outlined on the Data Collection, Surveys, and Data Processing pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs you make a plan for which data you need to collect and from where - it’s a great time to pause and think about what you actually need to answer the questions/objectives you have using an equity lens.\nAs a reminder - achieving racial equity outcomes means that race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved (Glossary)\nSo, as you create the list of data you want to collect for your project, it should contain:\n\nData that can represent your management question(s) or project objectives. See the Planning page for more guidance.\nData that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes. This may be limited to simple demographics data - but it could also be something more! Working with Tribal and community experts to decide what type(s) of data are most applicable to and reflective of their lived experiences as they relate to your management questions and project objectives is a great place to start! See the Data Collection page for more guidance.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Data Collection\nA good plan will include information that is sufficient to understand the nature of the data that is collected, including:\n\nTypes. A good first step is to list the various types of data that you expect to collect or create. This may include text, spreadsheets, software and algorithms, models, images and movies, audio files, and patient records. \nSources. Data may come from direct human observation, laboratory and field instruments, experiments, simulations, surveys, and compilations of data from other studies.\nVolume. Both the total volume of data and the total number of files that are expected to be collected can affect all other data management activities.\nData and file formats. Technology changes and formats that are acceptable today may soon be obsolete. Good choices include those formats that are nonproprietary, based upon open standards, and widely adopted and preferred by the larger data consuming community (e.g., Comma Separated Values [CSV] over Excel [.xls, xlsx]). Data are more accessible for the long term if they are uncompressed, unencrypted, and stored using standard character encodings.\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat data will we be collecting and/or generating?\nHow and in what format will the data be collected? Is it numerical data, image data, text sequences, or modeling data?\nWhat file formats will be used? Do these formats conform to an open standard and/or are they proprietary?\nHow much data will be generated for this project?\nAre you using data that someone else produced? If so, where is it from?\nHow long will the data be collected/generated and how often will it change?\nTo what extent do the data and methods of collection and use for this project abide by FAIR Principles of scientific data management and stewardship and CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance? If FAIR and CARE Principles are not being met - how can we modify our methods and processes data collection and use to better meet them?\n\n\n\n\nFAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) within the open data movement primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) for Indigenous Data Governance are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. Image credit: Global Indigenous Data Allianc\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Data Organization & Management\nDefine how and where the data will be organized and managed.\nFor example, your effort may require a small number of data tables and these can be effectively managed with spreadsheet programs like Excel. Larger data volumes and usage constraints may require the use of relational database management systems for linked data tables like ORACLE or mySQL, or a Geographic Information System (GIS) for geospatial data layers like ArcGIS, or computer programming languages like R or Python for large datasets that cannot be contained within standard database or GIS systems.\nThis section should contain just enough detail to identify basic data organization needs and plan, not the level of detail needed to build a comprehensive system or information technology project plan.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nHow and where will your data be organized?\nWhat tools or software are required to read or view the data?\nWhat directory and file naming convention will be used?\nWhat are your local storage and backup procedures?\nWill this data require secure storage?\nWho is responsible for managing the data? Who will ensure that the data management plan is carried out?\nWhat steps will be taken to protect privacy, security, confidentiality, intellectual property or other rights?\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Data Quality & Processing\nHere you will define the processes you will use to clean and prepare your data once it is collected - also known as tidying data. Tidy data are structured such that the data are easy to manipulate, model, and visualize - and getting data to the point of being tidy is often the most time consuming step of any data-intensive work. More detailed data processing/tidying steps are outlined on the Data Processing page.\nSimilar to the analysis step - you might not know all of the details of how the data will need to be tidied - what’s important for this section is that you think through the potential methods you will need to use to make disparate datasets interoperable and tidy so that they’re of acceptible quality and easy to use for your analysis and product development steps.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhich datasets (if any) will need to be merged/combined to be made useful for your project? If this needs to be done, how will you plan on doing it?\nWhat are your data quality objectives/standards?\nHow will you assess and establish the quality of the data you use?\nWhat rubric will you use to decide which data are kept and which are excluded from future steps?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Water Boards have a quality management system and overarching Quality Assurance Management Plan. Be sure to review this material to consider how your project falls in that that framework, and if more is needed. For example, many programs do NOT have Quality Assurance Program Plans, so this may be a step needed to occur to establish data quality objectives, etc.\nIn some cases the Quality Assurance and Data Management plans can be integrated (see this USGS Quality-Assurance and Data-Management Plan as an example)",

Solely relying on statistical outputs will not necessarily lead to insights without careful consideration during the analytic process, such as ensuring data quality is sufficient and determining appropriate statistical power. Disaggregation of data is also a series of tradeoffs. Without disaggregating data by subgroup, analysis can unintentionally gloss over inequity and lead to invisible experiences. On the other hand, when analysts create a subgroup, they may be shifting the focus of analysis to a specific population that is likely already over-surveilled. (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration)\nCentering racial equity means paying attention to which data are highlighted and how they are framed, as well as the readability and accessibility of the communication method. This involves strategic consideration of the audience and the mode of dissemination that most effectively conveys the information. There are many ways to communicate information. These include briefs, interactive documents, websites, dashboards, social media content, data walks, posters, briefs, and infographics. Regardless of the form, content geared toward the public should avoid jargon that may be otherwise appropriate for internal program staff or academic audiences, while also using person-centered language and translating materials into languages most applicable to your community context. (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration)  \nFurthermore, good quality data regarding marginalized communities is often lacking, but it is still important to discuss impacts to BIPOC communities. It may be appropriate in some cases to still present or analyze this data and also present caveats for the data limitations. In other cases, it may be more appropriate to rely only on qualitative discussion based on information derived from background research and feedback from affected communities.",

    "text": "12.1 Demographics Data Needs Context\nIt’s important to remember that you can always benefit from setting context before trying to communicate demographic or specific racial equity answers to questions posed by our Board, a member of the public, or a partner in this work. What your program is about, what does it do, how well does it do these things (aka Performance Report), etc. This may take a few different visualizations to help frame the context of the program mission but will help viewers understand how you are approaching the racial equity data work within the scope of your program.\nOften the go-to resources for making inferences to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics is the National Census dataset and the associated American Community Survey dataset. While we are fortunate to have just updated this dataset in 2020 there are limitations and potential inaccuracies associated with relying solely on census data to enumerate demographic characteristics within a given census tract. This tool from the Department of Finance exists to measure this limitation.\nA detailed example of using R programming to estimate demographics and other characteristics with U.S. census data to be used for custom spatial features is available and can be tailored to programs with the help of a data scientist proficient in R and staff familiar with the program.  https://daltare.github.io/example-census-race-ethnicity-calculation/example_census_race_ethnicity_calculation.html",

These missing values are distinct from zeros, which are also in the CES dataset. For more information about the missing (and zero) values, see the data dictionary (calenviroscreen40resultsdatadictionary_F_2021.pdf) that accompanies the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 results Excel workbook, available for download as a zip file here.\nIn the CES 4.0 data (for the version available as of April 2023), the shapefile containing CES 4.0 scores (available here) encodes these missing values as negative numbers (-999 for most variables, and -1998 for one variable). The Excel workbook containing CES 4.0 scores (available here) encodes these missing values as NA. Users should account for these missing values – and their different encodings – as needed when doing any analysis using CES data. Also, note that the CalEnviroScreen 3 shapefile (June 2018 update version) encoded missing values as 0, so users should be aware of this change if/when updating an analysis from CES 3 to CES 4.0 data.",

The boundaries of the census tracts defined by these simplified polygons do not always align with the boundaries of neighboring census tracts, resulting in slight gaps or overlaps between some neighboring census tracts. These inconsistencies are not likely to have a significant impact on most uses of the CES data, but they could impact some types of analysis based on CES data. For example, when assessing sites or facilities based on the CES score of the census tract they are located in, sites located near a census tract boundary could be associated with more than one census tract (and more than one CES score) in areas where there are overlapping census tract polygons, or not associated with any census tract (and no CES score) in areas where there are gaps between census tract polygons. This issue may be addressed in a future release of the CES dataset; in the meantime, a possible workaround is to use the official 2010 census tract boundaries from the US Census Bureau for any calculations, then use census tract IDs to tie this information to the associated CES score for each tract.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Turning Data into Information is Challenging - Even More so with Racial Equity Data Work\nTurning data into information in the context of racial equity involved navigating complex ethical considerations. The process requires an understanding of the potential impact on Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) communities and the responsibility to mitigate perpetuating or reinforcing biases. Upholding ethical standards requires a commitment to maintaining privacy, accessibility, and fostering transparency throughout the data transformation process. Additionally, acknowledging the limitations of the data and being transparent about potential biases is essential for maintaining the integrity of the data and information generated and shared. The transformation of racial equity data into meaningful information requires a thoughtful and intentional approach which we will highlight in the next sections.\nFor example, many programs will rely on demographic and socioeconomic data, like those collected from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). Because the ACS is based on a sample, rather than all housing units and people, ACS estimates have a degree of uncertainty associated with them, called sampling error. In general, the larger the sample, the smaller the level of sampling error. To help users understand the impact of sampling error on data reliability, the Census Bureau provides a “margin of error” for each published ACS estimate. The margin of error, combined with the ACS estimate, gives users a range of values within which the actual “real-world” value is likely to fall.  It is important to acknowledge this uncertainty up front to be transparent with your audience about the data and conclusions you are drawing.  For more information on using ACS data please see the Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know Handbook.  Also for an interactive tool that measures the potential inaccuracies associated with relying on census data to enumerate demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in California please explore: https://cacensus.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=48be59de0ba94a3dacff1c9116df8b37.\n\nAnother example of how to tell your data story in a transparent way can be found on the Office of Environmental Health and Hazard Assessment CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Race and Equity Analysis.  https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f555670d30a942e4b46b18293e2795a7",
