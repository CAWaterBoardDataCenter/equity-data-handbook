    "text": "9.4 Accessing & Downloading Software\nUse your computer’s Software Center to download most programs. You can also download & install some programs outside of the Software Center, such as Git, which may have a more recent version than what the Software Center provides. Some external software will not play nice with the VPN (e.g., Slack) so keep that in mind if you’re unable to connect and use some software.\nAlso see this Business Intelligence Handbook for guidance on buisness intelligence tools (i.e., software) that are available to Water Boards staff.\nIf you have issues accessing or downloading any of the below software, email the IT Help Desk and they can help you download and/or troubleshoot.\n\n9.4.1 ESRI Services (ArcGIS Pro/ArcGIS Portal) \n\nArcGIS Pro is the main desktop GIS application available to Water Boards staff. ArcGIS Pro can be downloaded from the Software Center. If you do not see ArcGIS Pro in the Software Center, contact the Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov so that they can add it your list of available applications. Future releases of ArcGIS Pro and other ESRI applications should be automatically added to the Software Center as they are approved by DIT. You can use the Software Center to update your installation. \nThe Water Boards ArcGIS Portal (https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/) is an online platform for publishing and sharing ESRI-produced GIS resources with others at the Water Boards. These resources can also be shared with people outside of the Water Boards (with approval). For those familiar with ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Portal is the enterprise version of ArcGIS Online. With ArcGIS Portal, you can: \n\nCreate and share maps, story maps, and other applications \nSearch for GIS content within the Water Boards \nCreate groups to share GIS information with colleagues \nDownload maps, layers, and GIS data for use in ArcGIS Pro and other applications \n\nTo activate your Water Boards ArcGIS Portal membership (required for viewing, downloading, and publishing resources on the portal), email the DIT GIS Unit at gis@waterboards.ca.gov.  \nTo log into Portal, use the same username and password that you use for your state-issued laptop or computer. \n\nUsername: The default format is “[your work PC login]@EPA” (e.g. jsmith@EPA) OR “epa\\[your work PC login]” (e.g. epa\\jsmith) \nPassword: [your work PC password] \n\nPublic sharing: Resources published on the ArcGIS Portal can be shared outside of the organization to the public (no Portal log-in required), but this requires approval from the DIT GIS Unit. See the Public Sharing Requirements on the GIS Unit wiki (start [gis] (ca.gov)) and ensure that you complete each one of the steps before you submit a completed Public Publishing Form to the GIS Unit. The approval process can take some time, depending on how complex your project is and how busy the GIS Unit staff are, so plan ahead if you are working against a deadline. \n\nFor more information about ArcGIS Pro and the Water Boards ArcGIS Portal, view the GIS Unit wiki.\n\n\n9.4.2 R & RStudio\nBoth are available in the Software Center\nGetting Access to R Shiny server\n\n\n9.4.3 Git & GitHub\nSigning up:\n\nYou will need a GitHub account to access work-related & open-access projects in GitHub. Jenny Bryan (R developer and professor) provides some recommendations for signing up for a GitHub account.\nWe also strongly recommend setting up 2-factor authentication, which is required for becoming a member of the official Water Boards GitHub organization (see below). To keep things simple, you can use the same authentication system (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator) as you do for logging into the VPN.\n\nGetting access to the Water Boards Water Data Center GitHub\n\nWhy join? So you can easily work with other GitHub users in the Water Boards, as well as have a central place to publish projects relevant to other Water Boards colleagues & the public. The Water Boards GitHub organization also has a “sandbox” team to test & process projects before pushing them to public access.\nFollow link above to learn more and connect with the WB GitHub organization managers to introduce yourself & request to join the WB GitHub organization\n\nHow do I connect my Water Boards computer to Git/GitHub?\n\nWhile there is plenty of work you can do in the browser in GitHub, the real power comes in using it as a version control system connected to your local computer.\nFor all users, we recommend GitHub Desktop, which is available in the Software Center. There are lots of good resources on how GitHub Desktop works – here are a few of our favorites:\n\nThe “installing and configuring” section from GitHub docs. The other section is useful, but non-seasoned users can ignore information about forks, branches, and pull requests.\nA ~22 minute Youtube video from Coder Coder introducing GitHub Desktop setup and workflow. For some of the workflow options, the instructor uses VS Code. If you do not use VS Code, I suggest writing a brief .txt file using Notepad instead (e.g., the text `hello world!` saved as index.txt) and saving that file in the same place as your repository to continue with the walkthrough. Non-seasoned users can ignore the section on ignoring files, branching, and pull requests (though the explanation is good!)\n\nFor R users who want to integrate a Git tab in their RStudio window, we recommend following Jenny Bryan’s directions on Happy Git with R, sections 4-13. If you have any questions, the current R users in SWAMP are happy to chat with you.\nIf you use the command line to access Git/GitHub, congratulations! You likely know more about using Git than many of the people currently in SWAMP - and we’d love to learn from you!\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Tableau\nTableau is a business intelligence tool that can connect to and access data from a wide variety of data sources, perform data preparation and cleaning tasks, produce interactive visualizations and dashboards, and publish these products on the web.\nTableau Software for Desktop\n\nTableau Desktop is the full (or unrestricted) version of Tableau that can be installed onto one’s state-issued laptop or desktop computer. Once installed, it can be run as a desktop application and visualizations can be published on either Tableau Public or Tableau Server. A limited number of Tableau Desktop licenses are available to Water Boards staff. These  licenses are named licenses only (not shared) and are tied to a specific user. Contact the DIT Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov to request a license or contact Rafael Maestu (Rafael.Maestu@Waterboards.ca.gov) in OIMA for further guidance. \n\n\n\nTableau Desktop Public Edition is the free version of Tableau Desktop that is available to all Water Boards staff. The software can be downloaded from the Tableau Public website (Tableau Public Product Download). If you run into any permissions issues trying to install the software package on your computer, you may need to request that the DIT Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov install it for you. Compared to Tableau Desktop, Tableau Desktop Public Edition has a number of significant limitations (e.g., limited size and file type of data sources, inability to save Tableau workbooks to the desktop, inability to control access to the Tableau workbook or the underlying data), so it is likely only useful for evaluation purposes or projects with a very limited scope. \n\nTableau Server\n\nTableau Server is an online platform for creating, publishing, and sharing Tableau data sources, visualizations, and dashboards. Tableau Server is a web-based platform, so it does not require an installation of Tableau Desktop or Tableau Desktop Public Edition, but its functionality is enhanced when the two are used together.  \nAccess: A Tableau Server account is required to create and publish resources on the platform. An account is also required to view non-public data visualizations hosted on the platform. Contact the DIT Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov to request access or contact Rafael Maestu (Rafael.Maestu@Waterboards.ca.gov) in OIMA for further guidance. Once your account is activated, log in using your workstation username/email and password.  \nAdvantages: \n\nSharing data sources: Data sources published on Tableau Server can be shared with others on your team or with others in the organization. \nAutomation: Data visualizations and sources published on Tableau Server can be automatically refreshed on a time schedule.  \n\n\n\n\nLimitations:\n\nTableau Server can be used to create data visualizations and dashboards like you would in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Desktop Public Edition.\nMost of the functionality is the same; however, there are some differences. For example, Tableau Server does not provide as many options for customizing and formatting your visualization.\nRelated to this, transferring and viewing Tableau files between Tableau Desktop software and Tableau Server can result in formatting issues.  \n\n\nPublishing Tableau Visualizations \n\nVisualizations created in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Desktop Public Edition can be published on Tableau Server or Tableau Public. Visualizations created in Tableau Server are automatically published on Tableau Server (sharing permissions can be changed in Tableau Server). \n\nTableau Server: Requires a Tableau Server account. See the Tableau Server section above. \nTableau Public: Requires a Tableau Public account. Free (self-registration). https://public.tableau.com/  \n\n\n\n\nOnce a visualization is published on Tableau Server or Tableau Public (and configured for public sharing), then that visualization can be embedded into a Water Boards web page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nReminder to add recommendations section once we hear about what RM recommends (i.e. Tableau Desktop Public or Tableau Server)\n\n\n\n\n9.4.5 PowerBI\n\n\n9.4.6 Zoom\n\nGetting access to the OIMA Zoom Account (or requesting a meeting)"

Managing multiple projects at once, given our limited resources – time, funding, capacity (i.e. on person can only do so much in a day!) can be challenging – so we like to make time to review all of our projects and prioritize them. This helps us focus our efforts and resources so that we can continue to make progress while also maintaining balance and preventing staff burnout.  \nHere are some opportunities to plan & prepare SWAMP projects and activities which serve our mission:  \nSWAMP Strategic Planning: Every three years or so, the SWAMP Team reviews and updates the SWAMP Strategic Plan to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth.\nProgram Work Plans: Every three years or so, SWAMP Program Leads review and update their program’s Work Plans to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth.\nIndividual Work Plans: In December/January of each year, we recommend taking time to update individual work plans to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth.

For those projects, data collection and processing can look very different. Usually it comes in the form of engagement with internal and external partners, listening to the needs of communities that can most benefit from SWAMP data, information, and products, and figuring out how to operationalize and evolve our products and systems to better serve those communities and our partners.
