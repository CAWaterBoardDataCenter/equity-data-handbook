    "text": "Welcome!\nThis is an online User Manual for the California Water Board’s Tribal Water Data Map (Map), written by the California State Water Resources Control Board’s (State Water Board) Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA).\nThe purpose of the Map is to increase awareness of and access to the Water Board’s water data resources that intersect with Tribal matters and needs. The interactive Map includes curated data layers that have been requested by tribal partners and that may be useful for California Native American Tribes (tribes) doing environmental or water related work.\nThe purpose of this User Manual is to provide guidance and context so it’s easier for all audiences to use the Map. Content in this User Manual includes curated information that the has been requested by tribal partners and/or that the development Team thinks may be helpful to reference when using the map.\nThis Quarto book is an open, living, and continuously iterating resource. If you have suggestions for additions or revisions you think should be incorporated into this book, please follow the guidance provided in the Contributing chapter."
