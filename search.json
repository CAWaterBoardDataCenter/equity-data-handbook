    "text": "When planning for your data project with an equity lens, it’s best to conduct a thorough equity assessment, or scoping process. Equity assessments1 are systematic examinations of available data and expert input on how various groups - especially those facing inequity or disparities - are or likely will be affected by a policy, program, or process. They aim to minimize unintended adverse outcomes and maximize opportunities and positive outcomes.\nThe steps to conducting an equity assessment are described below.\n\nStep 0: Project Scoping\nStep 1: Describe the selected program, policy, or process, and populations affected by it\nStep 2. Consider historical, societal, and policy context and drivers of disparities\nStep 3. Collect expert input, including from affected community members\nStep 4. Identify information sources and gaps\nStep 5. Analyze program/policy effects - potential or current - on people and communities\nStep 6. Plan for action and accountability\n\nAlthough these steps are numbered for clarity, teams should synthesize information from all steps rather than completing them in isolation or one at a time.\n\n\nTime frame and level of effort:\n\nPlan a detailed schedule that accounts for staff availability, budget, technical assistance needs, data availability, and the need to make decisions in a particular time frame.\nIdentify and document risks to the timeline, such as staff availability, or threats to the comprehensiveness of the assessment, such as lack of access to experts. Consider potential ways to mitigate risks.\n\nProject team:\n\nDefine roles for team members and assign responsibilities. Plan to share information at key milestones to synthesize information from different assessment steps.\nConsider how to meaningfully involve experts, including people with lived experience with relevant programs and topics; people in communities affected by the program, policy, or process; staff who work with program participants/beneficiaries; or representatives of other offices. Experts can contribute to the assessment process in several ways, such as suggesting data sources, providing multiple perspectives to inform and enhance the analysis, and developing recommendations for action.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the focus of the assessment to provide a foundation for all members of the assessment team and external partners.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the selected program, policy, or process, and what are its goals?\nWhat are the known successes or challenges in meeting those goals?\nWhat types of actions or policy levers are involved in the selected program, policy, or process (such as grants, contracts, waivers, guidance to partners, technical assistance, or other actions)?\nWhich of these actions will be included in the assessment?\nWhat general descriptive or performance data can the organization use to describe the program, policy, or process (such as number served, total funds distributed, uptake estimates, or other key outcomes)?\nAre there existing quantifiable performance targets relevant to the focus of the assessment? Provide a brief summary.\n\nIdentify and describe populations of interest\n\nWhat populations are participating in the program, policy, or process, including program participants/beneficiaries? Consider which characteristics are relevant and of interest, such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, income, religion, and rural geography.\nWhat populations are currently left out, or not participating or benefiting at desired rates or at the same rates as others? What are other disparities related to the selected program, policy, or process that are known at the outset of the assessment?\nWhat are the information sources for those inequities or disparities?  What is the comparison population or reference point for observed disparities? Reference point options include the total population in an area, the national population, the largest group, or a benchmark chosen through a planning process. Whenever possible, try to think critically about this population rather than simply defaulting to comparison populations used in the past.\nHow might population groups’ identifying characteristics overlap in ways that expose them to relatively greater inequities (known as intersectionality)? What implications does this overlap have for the impacts of the program, policy or process? For example, immigrants who are also LGBTQIA+ might face multiple barriers in accessing a particular program.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the context for observed disparities and the program or policy itself.\n\nWhat is the social and cultural history of the populations listed in Step 1 and how does this history shape their current conditions? How does this context play a role in how these populations might perceive, access, or otherwise interact with the program or policy?\nWhat structural or social drivers of disparities might explain observed disparities? Structural drivers of disparities are governing processes and economic and social policies that distribute power and resources in unfair ways, such as an inequitable distribution of emergency funds to certain communities. Social drivers of disparities are differences in the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, such as poverty, employment, housing, environment quality, transportation, food security, and community safety. Differences in these social conditions drive disparities. Although these conditions are also known as social determinants of health, this tool uses a broader term to encompass multiple outcomes, including both health outcomes and other outcomes (e.g., economic outcomes). Thinking through these drivers of disparities is important for placing focus on systems and institutions that need to be changed, and it helps to avoid blaming groups of people for poor outcomes.\nWhat is known about whether structural, systemic, or institutional racism or structural barriers affect the implementation and outcomes of previous programs or policies? Systemic or institutional racism refers to policies and practices that create or sustain disparate outcomes for persons of different races. An example is redlining, where financial services and other housing-related opportunities were restricted for individuals largely based on their race/ethnicity and originating neighborhoods (see this 2021 Memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development regarding Redressing Our Nation’s and the Federal Government’s History of Discriminatory Housing Practices and Policies)\n\n\n\n\nExperts can include former or current program participants/beneficiaries, members of communities affected by the program, policy, or process, staff who work with program participants/beneficiaries or affected communities, subject matter experts such as researchers, or staff in other organizations, among others. Sources of expert input on programs, policies, and processes include listening sessions, surveys, interviews, focus groups, and position papers by experts in the field or advocacy groups.\n\nHow will the assessment team engage experts with lived experience with relevant programs, policies, processes, and/or issues? To what extent can these experts be part of the assessment team?\nHow will the assessment team engage other experts in the equity assessment (in addition to potentially involving them in the assessment team)? Which experts will be engaged?\nWhat individuals or communities have historically been excluded or disempowered in decision making? How can they be included and meaningfully engaged?\nHow can the assessment team ensure inclusivity when engaging experts, such as translation services or accommodations for people with disabilities? Will there be different options for sharing input for people with different communication preferences or time or transportation constraints?\nHow will the assessment team work to decrease power dynamics and ensure that experts are comfortable providing candid input? How can the team be transparent about how input will be shared and used?\nWhat methods can the assessment team use to collect input, such as focus groups on participants/beneficiaries’ experiences with programs? What are experts’ experiences with current programs and policies, and what are their views on the benefits and burdens involved in participating?\nWhat are experts’ perceptions about barriers to participation? Can experts help the assessment team understand whether there are current or potential burdens or barriers that are more severe for certain population groups?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor more detailed guidance and resources regarding outreach and engagement, see the Practical Guidance Document developed by the Office of Public Participation.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a variety of qualitative and quantitative information sources to support the assessment, including gray and peer-reviewed literature, organization documents and administrative records, surveys, customer inquiry or complaint information, administrative data, program performance data, key informant interviews, and listening sessions or focus groups. Ideally, equity assessments often include both qualitative and quantitative data. Data sources can include, but should not be limited to, expert views.\n\nWhat are the quantitative data sources for the assessment process? Quantitative data such as program, administrative, or survey data shed light on the magnitude and prevalence of an inequity or an opportunity for improvement.\nAre available quantitative data disaggregated by relevant variables, such as race, ethnicity, income, and relevant geographic areas? If not, how can the assessment incorporate data that can help organizations understand or estimate the equity impacts of the program, policy, or process?\nWhat are the qualitative data sources for the assessment process? Qualitative data such as interview or focus group data increase understanding of context, as well as helping to interpret and understand quantitative data.\nAre there gaps or limitations in the information needed for the assessment? If either qualitative or quantitative data are not available, explain why. If there are gaps, how might the assessment team obtain new or better information, or highlight the need for investments in better data? It is important to describe gaps that might reflect historically overlooked inequities or point to the need for information sources that could be developed in future years.\n\n\n\n\nDrawing on all previous steps in the assessment process, analyze the available data and describe equity-related outcomes of the program, policy, or process. Describe findings with as much specificity as possible.\n\nWhat quantitative and qualitative analysis methods did the team use to analyze the available data? Did the team synthesize quantitative and qualitative data to develop a complete picture of current inequities or disparities related to the program, policy, or process?\nWhat are the assessment team’s findings on positive and negative equity-related outcomes of the program, policy, or process? What quantitative and qualitative evidence of inequities exists?\nWhat evidence is there of inequities in areas such as awareness of programs and benefits, processes and rules, administrative burden, access to services, participation, outcomes, quality, and engagement?\nHow do findings change the team’s understanding of disparities related to the selected program, policy, or process known at the outset of the assessment?\nWhat factors might be driving observed inequities or disparities? Are any of those factors potentially caused by the program or policy that is the focus of the assessment?\nHave experts helped the assessment team interpret the available data or validate or refine the initial findings?\nIn what ways might the findings be limited due to data gaps or analysis constraints? What findings point to the need for further research?\n\n\n\n\nDevelop a detailed plan to address inequities identified in Step 5 within the scope of your program.\n\nWhat solutions are needed to resolve observed inequities or disparities, or to address identified drivers of those inequities or disparities? Which solutions are in the program’s sphere of authority?\nWhat are the program’s short-term and long-term goals for improvement? Quantify those goals if possible.\nWhat steps will the program take to accomplish each goal? What coordination, training, information systems changes, business process changes, or other implementation actions are needed?\nHave subject matter experts—including those with lived experience—weighed in on needed solutions, proposed goals, or planned action steps? Are all components of the improvement plan responsive to the needs and cultures of different populations or communities?\nWhat resources will the program need to carry out the improvement plan?\nHas the program consulted or collaborated with key partners on potential improvement options and actions?\nIn what ways could the program coordinate with other partners to achieve equity improvements that are not solely within the control or influence of the program conducting the assessment?\n\nAdditional follow-up actions help programs learn about equity impacts and whether implementation should be adjusted to realize positive outcomes. In addition, equity assessments have the potential to generate many new lessons about equity that could be helpful for other partners. Articulating plans for these actions is part of the equity assessment even though these actions occur after the formal assessment is over.\n\nWould sharing the equity assessment with other partners support collaboration on other policies and programs intended to benefit priority populations?\nWould sharing the equity assessment or a summary of findings with experts who were not directly involved in the assessment further promote equity through transparency and accountability?\nWhat measures or indicators will the program use to track progress over time? Are these disaggregated individual-level or community-level measures? Monitoring can help the program assess whether patterns or trends are in the expected direction or require course corrections.\nHow and when will the organization evaluate the results of potential program changes? Evaluations focus on whether programs or policies reach their goals within a defined period. How can the organization design an equitable and inclusive evaluation?\nWho will be responsible for developing and executing monitoring and evaluation plans?  \nWill the program share monitoring and evaluation results with the experts involved in the assessment or other partners? If so, how?",

    "text": "As you’re in the Planning phase of conducting your Equity Assessment, we recommend documenting what you are doing for the remaining phases of the data life cycle and making that documentation as open and transparent as possible. This is best accomplished through the use of a Data Management Plan.\nA Data Management Plan describes what data will be used, how the data will be collected, processed, and managed to conduct your analysis, visualization or other products, and how those data products will be stored, shared, and maintained over the long-term. In other words, the Data Management Plan describes how the project team intends to address and manage each phase of the data life cycle.\nDepending on the complexity of the project, your data management plan can be relatively short, and it can be used as a way to begin to engage with experts and partners that are interested in your project!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry using the development of your Data Management Plan as a way to build relationships and trust with Tribal and community experts!\nSome ideas for how to do this include:\n\nYou can create a Technical Advisory group composed of Tribal and community experts that helps co-create the Data Management Plan with the Project Team.\nThe Project Team develops the Data Management Plan, but solicits feedback on early versions from Tribal and community experts and makes revisions according to their feedback.\n\n\n\nA Data Management Plan should include the following sections:\n\nProject Introduction & Context\nData Collection & Processing\nData Analysis & Product Development\nData & Product Preservation & Storage\nData & Product Publication & Sharing\nData & Product Documentation\nData & Product Evaluation\nOther Potential Sections or Potential Appendices, including: Acknowledgements, Timeline, Project Roles and Responsibilities, Dataset Details, Survey Details, Future work\n\nSince the development the Data Management Plan takes place before data are actually collected, some details, like specific analytical methods, may not be completely worked out. However, the Data Management Plan should include a clear vision and general plan for each section and include as much detail as possible.\n\n\nHere you want to briefly describe the project and the mechanism(s) driving the data collection and product development. Much of this will likely be worked out during the Planning phase, including:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the selected program, policy, or process, related to this project?\nWhat are the objectives of the project?\nWho is the intended audience of the project?\nHow do you envision the project’s resulting data and products contribute to the advancement and operationalization of equity for your the program, policy, or process, related to this project?\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will identify the data you plan on collecting, how you will collect it, and how you organize, manage, and process said data once it is collected. More detailed guidance on collection and processing of data and resultant products is outlined on the Data Collection (including information on Surveys), and Data Processing pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to pause and think about what you actually need to answer the questions/objectives you have using an equity lens.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder - achieving racial equity outcomes means that race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved (Glossary)\nSo, as you create the list of data you want to collect for your project, it should contain:\n\nData that can represent your management question(s) or project objectives. See the Planning page for more guidance.\nData that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes. This may be limited to simple demographics data - but it could also be something more! Working with Tribal and community experts to decide what type(s) of data are most applicable to and reflective of their lived experiences as they relate to your management questions and project objectives is a great place to start! See the Data Collection page for more guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\nA good plan will include information that is sufficient to understand the nature of the data that is collected, including:\n\nTypes. A good first step is to list the various types of data that you expect to collect or create. This may include text, spreadsheets, software and algorithms, models, images and movies, audio files, and patient records. \nSources. Data may come from direct human observation, laboratory and field instruments, experiments, simulations, surveys, and compilations of data from other studies.\nVolume. Both the total volume of data and the total number of files that are expected to be collected can affect all other data management activities.\nData and file formats. Technology changes and formats that are acceptable today may soon be obsolete. Good choices include those formats that are nonproprietary, based upon open standards, and widely adopted and preferred by the larger data consuming community (e.g., Comma Separated Values [CSV] over Excel [.xls, xlsx]). Data are more accessible for the long term if they are uncompressed, unencrypted, and stored using standard character encodings.\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat data will we be collecting and/or generating?\nHow and in what format will the data be collected? Is it numerical data, image data, text sequences, or modeling data?\nWhat file formats will be used? Do these formats conform to an open standard and/or are they proprietary?\nHow much data will be generated for this project?\nAre you using data that someone else produced? If so, where is it from?\nHow long will the data be collected/generated and how often will it change?\nTo what extent do the data and methods of collection and use for this project abide by FAIR Principles of scientific data management and stewardship and CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance? If FAIR and CARE Principles are not being met - how can we modify our methods and processes data collection and use to better meet them?\n\n\n\n\nFAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) within the open data movement primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) for Indigenous Data Governance are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. Image credit: Global Indigenous Data Allianc\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine how and where the data will be organized and managed.\nFor example, your effort may require a small number of data tables and these can be effectively managed with spreadsheet programs like Excel. Larger data volumes and usage constraints may require the use of relational database management systems for linked data tables like ORACLE or mySQL, or a Geographic Information System (GIS) for geospatial data layers like ArcGIS, or computer programming languages like R or Python for large datasets that cannot be contained within standard database or GIS systems.\nThis section should contain just enough detail to identify basic data organization needs and plan, not the level of detail needed to build a comprehensive system or information technology project plan.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nHow and where will your data be organized?\nWhat tools or software are required to read or view the data?\nWhat directory and file naming convention will be used?\nWhat are your local storage and backup procedures?\nWill this data require secure storage?\nWho is responsible for managing the data? Who will ensure that the data management plan is carried out?\nWhat steps will be taken to protect privacy, security, confidentiality, intellectual property or other rights?\n\n\n\n\nHere you will define the processes you will use to clean and prepare your data once it is collected - also known as tidying data. Tidy data are structured such that the data are easy to manipulate, model, and visualize - and getting data to the point of being tidy is often the most time consuming step of any data-intensive work. More detailed data processing/tidying steps are outlined on the Data Processing page.\nSimilar to the analysis step - you might not know all of the details of how the data will need to be tidied - what’s important for this section is that you think through the potential methods you will need to use to make disparate datasets interoperable and tidy so that they’re of acceptable quality and easy to use for your analysis and product development steps.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhich datasets (if any) will need to be merged/combined to be made useful for your project? If this needs to be done, how will you plan on doing it?\nWhat are your data quality objectives/standards?\nHow will you assess and establish the quality of the data you use?\nWhat rubric will you use to decide which data are kept and which are excluded from future steps?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider how your project aligns with the Water Boards Quality Management System!\n\n\n\nThe Water Boards have a quality management system and overarching Quality Assurance Management Plan. Be sure to review this material to consider how your project falls in that framework, and if more is needed to ensure your all aspects of your project are of sufficient quality. For example, many programs do NOT have Quality Assurance Program Plans, so this may be a step needed to occur to establish data quality objectives, etc.\nIn some cases the Quality Assurance and Data Management plans can be integrated (see this USGS Quality-Assurance and Data-Management Plan as an example)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how you intend on using the data and the general plan or intended workflow you envision for your data analysis and/or product development phase. If you know you will use certain formulas, methods, or software for this step, you will identify them here. More detailed guidance on data analysis and product development steps are outlined on the Data Analysis and Data Visualization pages.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat management questions are you planning on answering or informing with this data and project?\n\nIf operational decision making is the use please identify which performance measures or existing resource allocation planning processes that will be using the data (e.g., assigning inspections to staff, determining priority for compliance assurance work, etc.).\nPlease also identify any business interests that will need to be alerted to the data / products and may have concerns over its quality, etc. For example, invoicing for fees will need to have updated information, etc.\n\nWhat workflow will you use to analyse the data and/or develop the resultant data product?\nWhat data analysis or visualization methods or software will you use?\nWhat product(s) will be developed (e.g. analyses, visualizations, applications, reports, etc.)\nWhat opportunities will Tribal and community partners have to review and provide feedback on the data analysis or product development before it is finalized?\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how and where you plan on preserving and storing data and products once they are developed. More detailed guidance on preservation and storage of data and resultant products is outlined on the Preservation & Storage page.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nHow and where will you store and secure your data and resultant products (code, results, products, visualizations, applications, etc.)?\nWhat privacy and confidentiality issues must you address?\nWhat are your plans for preserving the data/products after the project is completed?\nWhat procedures will you use to ensure long-term archiving and preservation of your data?\nAt what point will data, code/scripts, and resultant products/applications be archived or deleted?\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how and where you plan on publishing, sharing and otherwise making accessible the project’s data and products once they are developed. More detailed guidance on publishing and sharing data and resultant products is outlined on the Data Sharing page.\nThe Water Boards typically make virtually all of the data we collect available to the public. The exceptions are confidential information (e.g., part of ongoing enforcement actions and/or formal Tribal consultations) and some personally identifiable information (PII). This section should describe any policies that will filter out data from the step of making the data publicly available and, more importantly, how the project plans to provide access to the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake your project as open and accessible as possible and appropriate!\n\n\n\nPublishing and sharing Water Boards data and resultant products is critical for collaboration and transparency of our data, products, and workflows. Your project should be in alignment with the Water Board’s Open Data Resolution: “Adopting Principles of Open Data as a Core Value and Directing Programs and Activities to Implement Strategic Actions to Improve Data Accessibility and Associated Innovation.”\nThis means:\n\nDocumenting your process throughout the project so as to make it open, transparent, and reproducible\nUtilizing open data and open source software (e.g. Python, R) as much as possible\nMaking the data you use and code you develop transparent and accessible to the public after the project is complete, as appropriate\n\n\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat data and products will be shared, and when?\nWhere and how will data and products be made open and/or accessible?\n\nDatasets that are of high value should, at minimum, be published to the California Open Data Portal in the form of machine readable, well documented, maintained data.\nGeospatial products of high value should, at minimum, be published to the California State Geoportal.\nCode and similar products (scripts, analysis packages) should, at minimum, be published on the Water Boards GitHub in its own, well documented, project repository.\nFor all other data or products, please indicate how the data/product will be made accessible (e.g., via search forms at SMARTS public reports page, etc.).\n\nDoes sharing the data raise privacy, ethical, or confidentiality concerns?  Do you have a plan to protect or anonymize data, if needed?\nIf you collected data directly from Tribes or communities -\n\nHow will permission be obtained to use and disseminate the data?\nHow is informed consent being handled and how is privacy being protected?\nHow and when will you communicate what will or will not be shared?\n\nTo what extent do the methods of publication and sharing of data, products developed through this project abide by FAIR Principles of scientific data management and stewardship and CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance? If FAIR and CARE Principles are not being met - how can we modify our methods and processes of publication and sharing to better meet them?\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how and where every aspect of the project will be well documented. More detailed guidance on describing the project’s data and products is outlined on the Documentation page.\nMetadata - the details about what, where, when, why, and how the data were collected, processed, and interpreted - provide the information that enables data and files to be discovered, used, and properly cited. Metadata and other project documentation include descriptions of how data and files are named, physically structured, and stored as well as details about the experiments, analytical/visualization methods, project context, and names long-term data/product/project managers/stewards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe utility and longevity of data and products relate directly to how complete and comprehensive the metadata and documentation are.\n\n\n\nThe amount of effort devoted to creating comprehensive metadata and documentation may vary substantially based on the complexity, types, and volume of data/products developed throughout the life of a project - but it’s safe to assume (and plan for) a substantial amount of time and energy will be required to develop adequate metadata and documentation.\n\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat types of metadata will be produced alongside the data?\nWhat metadata standards will be used? Are you using metadata that is standard to your field?\nHow will the metadata be managed and stored?\nWhat other documentation will be developed for the project and associated products (e.g. workflows, standard operating procedures, data or product use or interpretation guidance, etc.)? Where will that be stored? How will it be made accessible and shared?\nIf you collected data or partnered directly from Tribes or communities -\n\nDoes it make sense to have these same partners review and provide feedback on your metadata and documentation materials? Doing so would help ensure that documentation is clear, simple, and accessible to a wide array of audiences.\nWhen and how will you share the aforementioned documentation with your partners?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe how you will evaluate the data, products, and outcomes of the project after it is complete, to assess the extent to which the project has achieved the goals you set for it and advanced and improved equity outcomes. More detailed guidance on describing the project’s data and products is outlined on the Evaluation page.\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nAt what point(s) during the project’s life cycle will you conduct your evaluation? (You don’t need to wait until the project is complete to benefit from this phase!)\nWhat evaluation method(s) will you use?\nHow can the project design an equitable and inclusive evaluation?\nWill the project team share evaluation findings with the experts or other partners involved in the project? If so, with whom will you share it, and how?\nWould sharing the project’s evaluation findings with the experts or other partners who were NOT directly involved in the project further promote equity through transparency and accountability? If so, with whom will you share it, and how?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Data Management Plan was developed by a group that included external partners, we recommend including an acknowledgements section to acknowledge, express appreciation, and give credit to those efforts.\n\n\n\nIncluding a timeline for project implementation is always recommended (even though it is more of a project management tool than a data management tool) and even if specific dates are not yet known. Including a timeline helps keep ourselves accountable and makes it easier for potential partners see when their contributions, feedback, and partnership might be needed so they can plan ahead and be ready for when its their time to engage.\n\n\n\nIf there are multiple people on the team that will be involved with project implementation, it might be a good idea to define who will be responsible for which parts of the project/data life cycle so that everyone is clear on their roles and responsibilities to this project ( even though it is more of a project management tool than a data management tool).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSpelling out project roles and responsibilities during this phase can help identify gaps and resource needs early!\nThis will enable the project team, management, and/or project partners to understand the limitations and dedicate time and resources to find more team members that can help fill those gaps before the project is underway. Doing this will ultimately prevent the project from being delayed, stalled, or put on hold after time, energy, and resources have already been expended (or even wasted).\n\n\nYou might include a Project Roles and Responsibilities table that includes:\n\nData Life Cycle Phase\nRole Title (e.g. project manager, data collection coordinator, data manager, data analysis lead, data product developer, project engagement lead, etc.)\nName (Affiliation)\nResponsibilities (with a short list of responsibilities associated with that role)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this section is making it easy for readers to see and understand the content of your data sources without having to view data directly. You might include a data schema for the datasets of interest. A data schema shows what the “guts” of your data will look like, including the identification of tables, columns/fields, data types, constraints, and relationships. This could be provided as a single table that includes your column/field names, and data types or something much more complex that better suits the needs of your project. For a simple example, see Appendix 1 of the SWAMP Bioassessment Reporting Module Data Management Plan.\n\n\n\nIf your project involves collecting data through a survey, you might use this section to document your intended survey questions and possible responses or response types.\n\n\n\nHere you might describe next steps or project ideas that are outside the scope and timelines of the current project, but that you see as being directly related to or building upon the current project.\n\n\n\n\n\nDMP Tool (a web-based tool that helps you construct data management plans using templates that address specific funder requirements) \nCA Healthy Watersheds Partnership Assessment Guidance: Data Acquisition, Monitoring and Management\nUSGS - Data Management Plans\nMIT Libraries - Write a Data Management Plan\nHarvard Medical School - Data Management Plans\nUniversity of Arizona - Data Management Plans Overview\nNational Institutes of Health Data Management Resources\nFAIR and CARE Principles Resources\n\nOperationalizing the CARE and FAIR Principles for Indigenous data futures\nEnabling FAIR data in Earth and environmental science with community-centric (meta)data reporting formats\nEarth Science Data Repositories: Implementing the CARE Principles (O’Brien et al., 2024)",

More detailed guidance on collection and processing of data and resultant products is outlined on the Data Collection (including information on Surveys), and Data Processing pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to pause and think about what you actually need to answer the questions/objectives you have using an equity lens.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder - achieving racial equity outcomes means that race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved (Glossary)\nSo, as you create the list of data you want to collect for your project, it should contain:\n\nData that can represent your management question(s) or project objectives. See the Planning page for more guidance.\nData that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes. This may be limited to simple demographics data - but it could also be something more! Working with Tribal and community experts to decide what type(s) of data are most applicable to and reflective of their lived experiences as they relate to your management questions and project objectives is a great place to start! See the Data Collection page for more guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\nA good plan will include information that is sufficient to understand the nature of the data that is collected, including:\n\nTypes. A good first step is to list the various types of data that you expect to collect or create. This may include text, spreadsheets, software and algorithms, models, images and movies, audio files, and patient records. \nSources. Data may come from direct human observation, laboratory and field instruments, experiments, simulations, surveys, and compilations of data from other studies.\nVolume. Both the total volume of data and the total number of files that are expected to be collected can affect all other data management activities.\nData and file formats. Technology changes and formats that are acceptable today may soon be obsolete. Good choices include those formats that are nonproprietary, based upon open standards, and widely adopted and preferred by the larger data consuming community (e.g., Comma Separated Values [CSV] over Excel [.xls, xlsx]). Data are more accessible for the long term if they are uncompressed, unencrypted, and stored using standard character encodings.\n\nSome questions to help guide the development of this section include:\n\nWhat data will we be collecting and/or generating?\nHow and in what format will the data be collected? Is it numerical data, image data, text sequences, or modeling data?\nWhat file formats will be used? Do these formats conform to an open standard and/or are they proprietary?\nHow much data will be generated for this project?\nAre you using data that someone else produced? If so, where is it from?\nHow long will the data be collected/generated and how often will it change?\nTo what extent do the data and methods of collection and use for this project abide by FAIR Principles of scientific data management and stewardship and CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance? If FAIR and CARE Principles are not being met - how can we modify our methods and processes data collection and use to better meet them?\n\n\n\n\nFAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) within the open data movement primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts.

    "text": "Effective and equitable communication of the information we have gleaned from our analyses involves strategic consideration of the audience and the mode of dissemination that most effectively conveys that information. There are many ways to communicate information, including briefs, interactive documents, websites, dashboards, social media content, data walks, posters, briefs, and infographics. Regardless of the form, content should integrate the recommendations below.\nEffective data visualizations - the ones that stick with us, can help us understand complex issues, and those that encourage us to change our behaviors and actions to be more equitable, inclusive, and kind - are more than points on a map. Great data visualizations are communication tools that are user-centered and tell a compelling story that connects with the audience.\n\n\n\nVenn diagram of the components of data communication that make a product work for a particular audience: Content, Medium and Access. Graphic from We All Count\n\n\nWhen thinking of the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom graphic at the top of the Data Analysis page: data visualizations are tools we can use to add context and meaning to data to create information and knowledge. Ideally, the insights gleaned from our visualizations can then be used to make data and equity-informed decisions and to take effective and impactful action.\n\n\nWhen it comes to creating data visualizations with an equity lens, it boils down to making decisions that consider equity and inclusion in the way results are shown and communicated, and that promote accessibility of the data, information, and tool as a whole. As you develop your data visualization or equivalent application - be sure to keep the below considerations in mind and make data, communication, and design choices that support the advancement of equity, inclusion, and justice.\n\n\nConsider who the audience will be for the product you’re developing and make decisions that will prioritize their needs so they are able to easily and efficiently use, engage and interact with the product.\n\n\n\nGraphic illustrating three key components of the user-centered design process: Research, Empathy, and Iteration. Image from Justinmind (2020)\n\n\nResearch - Let’s use an equity lens here. Instead of “researching” your users and audience, try getting to know them by prioritizing relationship and trust building through meaningful engagement. Ideally, by the time you’re at this data visualization phase, you have already identified the audience and key partners, and have been working or engaging with them during other phases of the project. See the Planning section on collecting expert input for more guidance on outreach and engagement.\nEmpathy - According to Dr. Brené Brown: empathy is about feeling WITH people, and requires four qualities:\n\nPerspective taking and believing the other person when they share their experience with you\nStaying out of judgement and listening\nRecognizing emotion in another person that you have maybe felt before\nCommunicating that you can recognize that emotion\n\nIntegrating empathy into our data-intensive work requires us to consider how our audience and/or the communities whose data are being used will perceive or be impacted by our work. It means ensuring we’re developing the product and thinking about the data as more than mere points on a map or visualization, but as representing real humans, environments, and conditions that should be contextualized and considered with care. Some questions to consider include:\n\nWho is vulnerable in this context and how would they want to be counted?\nWhat information would they need to improve their lives?\nWho is undercounted or possibly missing entirely?\nWho was counted? Who did the counting? Why were they asking these people?\nWho benefits or is harmed if you forget the dots are people?\n\nIteration - The key here is knowing and planning for an iterative process from the beginning. Add the feedback, implementation, and testing loop(s) into your project plan and allocate appropriate time and resources to adequately support each step. When working with partners or communities using an iterative approach, be sure to consider:\n\nWhen it is appropriate to ask for feedback, and when it might be burdensome?\nWhat are the different ways feedback might be gathered? We might think sending an email with a poll or survey linked is the easiest, but our partner might find it easier to talk through questions over the phone with you. Knowing which method(s) to use comes with time and relationship. When in doubt - ask for what people prefer and do your best to accommodate those needs.\nHow much time is adequate for folks to be able to review what you send them and provide their feedback? When in doubt - plan for a longer feedback period than you think might be needed and confirm timelines with your partners (and adjust them if you can when your partners indicate more or less time is needed)\n\n\n\n\nCentering racial equity means paying attention to how to most effectively convey information to the audience, and insuring that the content is using plain, accessible, and inclusive language.\nPlain Language - Plain language is writing designed to ensure the audience can understand what you’re trying to communicate as easily, quickly, and comprehensively as possible. This means:\n\nAvoiding convoluted or verbose language\nAvoiding the use of jargon and acronyms\nMaking critical information easy to see and understand\nUsing a conversational rather than legal or bureaucratic tone\n\nFor more guidance on plain language, see:\n\nCenter for Plain Language\nPlainLanguage.gov\nWater Boards Staff may also request plain language review from the Office of Public Participation, although that service is more geared towards the review of fact sheets, brochures, and FAQs rather than data visualizations or other data products at this time.\nHealthy Watershed Partnership Guidance on Communicating Results\n\nAccessible Language - Making language accessible to your audience may also require the translation of products (or product components) into the primary languages used by your audience. The Water Board’s Linguistic Isolation Tool can be used to help understand the different languages that are used by communities across the state.\nWater Boards Staff may also request translation services from the Office of Public Participation, although that service is more geared towards the translation of documents, rather than data visualizations or other data products at this time.\nInclusive Language - Words matter. The language we use in our products can be a way for us to show respect, empathy, and care for the communities connected to or impacted by the data. It’s important to be mindful of the language and terms we use (see Non-Inclusive Terms to Avoid for examples). The UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup recommends we ask ourselves the following questions when we need to decide on language to use in our data products:\n\nDo the words seek to fix, blame, shame, or change communities that are most marginalized, OR do they seek to address the oppressive systems that impact these communities?\nAre the words racialized? Do the terms have a racist or colonialist implication? An example is the phrase “at risk.” Close your eyes and say the phrase “at risk.” Does a picture of a certain group or community come to mind? If so, stop and pick another word.\nIs the language people-centered? Or do the phrases objectify communities? Distinguish between calling communities a name and describing what they are experiencing. For example: “people with disabilities,” “a person with asthma,” or “communities of color.”\nHow am I framing the words? What is the context and culture we are creating and perpetuating by using the words? Are the words positioning the communities we serve to live in their personal and collective power while addressing systemic oppression?\nDo the words dehumanize the communities we serve? Words that take away agency, self-determination, or personal power and do not recognize communities’ inherent strengths and assets should be avoided.\n\n\n\n\nReview considerations provided on the Data Collection page and think through how those should be applied as you visualize and communicate the data and results of your project.\n\n\n\n\n“While data may seem cut and dry, people are not”\n- P. Kim Bui, Director of audience innovation at the Arizona Republic and author of Designing data visualisations with empathy\n\nHumans are hardwired for story. Plopping points on a map or throwing together an interactive chart without adding context is not only insufficient, its ineffective!\nTake the time to tell a story with the visualization or product you’re developing. Walk the audience through the the messages you want to convey - connect with their emotions, and back it up with the data. If you’re unsure what the story of your data is, or how to communicate it effectively, try collecting and distilling your thoughts using a COMPASS Message Box:\n\n\n\nThe COMPASS Message Box is a tool to help scientists sort and distill their (often technical or complex) knowledge in a way that will resonate with their chosen audience. Users complete the sections in any order and can then use the distilled information to communicate their science more effectively.\n\n\nEscape from the Ivory Tower: A Guide to Making Your Science Matter (Baron, 2010) is another great science communication resource.\n\n\n\n\nThis section walks through the different design decisions data practitioners must think through when developing a data visualization or similar data product, and provides recommendations on how to approach the work through a lens of accessibility, equity, and inclusion.\nData visualization design is composed of a series of compromises: Complexity vs Clarity. Depth vs. Speed. Pretty vs. Practical. The best visualizations maximize all of these, but usually, you have to prioritize some things over others. When designing a data visualization or similar data communication product, data practitioners should make decisions with their audience and equity in mind and do their best to follow the recommendations below to make the final data product as accessible and inclusive as possible.\n\n\nAlt Text is descriptive text, usually associated with images or figures, that conveys the meaning and context of the item. When creating alt text, remember:\n\nIt should complement the caption and not replicate it\nUse language to describe what the audience should take away from looking at the item\nIf there is text in the item, that text should be spelled out in the alt text\n\nTest to see if your alt text is effective by asking a colleague or project partner to listen to you (or a screen reader - see below) read the text aloud to them BEFORE they look at the item. Then, have them look at the item and ask if there are other details about the item that stand out to them as contributing to the meaning behind the item. If there are, add them in!\nScreen readers are computer software that read the text aloud and include programs like NVDA, JAWS, Acrobat, Word. A screen reader may already be integrated into your data visualization tool - if not, NVDA is free to download and is the Water Boards standard.\n\n\n\nColor can be a powerful communicator that should be selected purposefully. If we aren’t intentional with the colors we choose we may be unintentionally perpetuating stereotypes, creating hierarchies, or using color palettes that are not accessible to those with color vision differences.\nWhen selecting colors for your visualization or data product, consider the recommendations from the UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup and the Urban Institute Data Visualization Style Guide:\n\nSelect the color palettes according to the message you’re trying to convey:\n\nCategorical palettes are best when you want to distinguish discrete chunks of data that do not have an inherent ordering. It’s best to use a palette that has bold, contrasting, non-gradient colors.\nSequential palettes are best when data range from relatively low or uninteresting values to relatively high or interesting values. It’s best to use a palette that has a relatively subtle shift in hue accompanied by a large shift in brightness and saturation.\n\nAvoid reinforcing stereotypes (e.g. using pink to represent female populations, and blue to represent male populations, using colors associated with skin tones or racial stereotypes).\nWhen thinking about demographic data:\n\nNot using color to differentiate between demographic groups helps avoid unintentionally creating a hierarchy between groups and reinforcing stereotypes, and instead enables color to be used to highlight group differences and assist with interpreting the data.\nIf color is determined to be necessary to differentiate between groups, the palette should be chosen carefully. Avoid using incremental color palettes (e.g., light to dark) to represent different demographic groups. Bold and contrasting, non-gradient color palettes are a best practice when displaying demographic data and incorporating color.\nConsider plotting data disaggregated by race or ethnicity in their own separate charts, instead of plotting all disaggregated groups together in a single chart.\n\nPlotting all groups on the same chart encourages comparison using a “deficit-based perspective” that focuses attention on what low-performing / worse off groups are lacking when compared with the high performing / better off groups.\nPlotting a set of small multiples faceted by each racial or ethnic group can better encourage viewers to think about the specific needs and challenges facing each group.\n\n\nAvoid using red to green color combinations. Daltonism (i.e., Dichromacy) is the most common type of color vision difference, affecting up to 1 in 12 males (8%) and 1 in 200 females (0.5%), and it makes certain shades of green look more red.\nDo not use color or shading alone to convey data or information. Instead pair color with patterns, textures, or shapes to convey data or information.\nAvoid using too many colors, shapes, and/or patterns at the same time. Our brains can really only hold (or effectively understand) three to five complex concepts at once. If you need to use six or more colors to represent the data - it might feel cluttered or overwhelming to the viewers. Consider consolidating categories or breaking up the chart into multiple smaller charts as described above.\nA 3:1 contrast ratio is required for figures if a person must perceive a graphic in order to understand the content (e.g., colored lines in graphs, points on maps). However, text that is embedded in a graphic must meet a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 unless the text is incidental or there is no way of presenting the graphic with sufficient contrast without undermining the meaning. Use the Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA) or equivalent software to determine if the figure meets the ratio requirements.\n\nTools to help with color selection may already be integrated into your data visualization tools - if not, some other resources include:\n\nColor Brewer – tool to help create accessible color schemes for maps\nNon-exhaustive list of color vision difference simulators – Color Oracle, Coblis\nNon-exhaustive list of color palette packages for R – Base R Color Palette Guide, RColorBrewer, rcartocolor, viridis\nPaletton – tool to help explore colors and palettes\nWebAIM – color contract checker\n\n\n\n\nAs data practitioners, you decide how your audience will be able to view the data through your visualization or data product. While we might think that data are objective (spoiler - they’re not), how they’re presented impacts how they’re interpreted, perceived, and ultimately valued and acted upon. How we present the data impacts which stories we tell (or don’t tell).\nThe graphic below, from Data Feminism, illustrates how the same data can tell different stories depending on their presentation. The graphic on the left tells a story of how the unemployment has fallen substantially since it’s recent peak and might be interpreted as “good news”. The graphic on the right tells a story of how the unemployment rate has been consistently above 8% for a long time period and might be interpreted as “bad news”.\n\n\n\nTwo figures presenting the same data in different ways. Graphic from Data Feminism\n\n\nWhen selecting figure or chart types for your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nHow does the chart you use frame or present the data? What is the context and culture we are creating and perpetuating by presenting the data in that way? Are the charts we’re using positioning the communities we serve to live in their personal and collective power while addressing systemic oppression?\nIs the chart used appropriate for the data you want to display? Think about your variables (string/categorical and numeric), the volume of data, and the question you are attempting to answer or the story you’re trying to tell through the visualization or data product.\nWill the chart type be easily interpreted by the audience? Sometimes data practitioners might be inclined to use a complex chart so we can display more data at once (or just because we think it’s cool!). In moments like these, remember the words of Leonardo da Vinci — “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Think about what will be the most easy to understand and impactful for your audience.\nHow can I use the textual components of the chart (i.e., title, axis and other labels, legend, notes, caption, tooltips) to communicate simply and with clarity? More is not always more here. If context is provided elsewhere in the visualization or data product, maybe the title, caption, or tooltips are redundant. If there is only one data category that can be described by the title or caption, maybe a legend is not necessary. Think about what is essential and what can be removed or omitted to improve your clarity and communication.\nHow can other chart components (i.e. gridlines, axis lines/ticks, scales, spacing) be used to communicate simply and with clarity? If you have a lot of data on the chart - do gridlines help make sense of things, or cause confusion and clutter? Are there enough empty or negative spaces in the chart so that viewers are given the “visual breathing room” needed to easily absorb the messages you’re hoping the data conveys?\n\nTools to help with chart selection include:\n\nCool Infographics Data Visualization Guides – collection of data visualization chart choosers, reference guides, cheat sheets, websites and infographics about data visualization design best practices.\n\n\n\n\nThe fonts and typography we use determine how easy (or not) it is for the audience to efficiently read and comprehend whatever it is you’re trying to communicate. Typography (the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed) within a chart and visualization is a way to establish a hierarchy among elements within the visualization or data product and guides the reader through the visual product.\nWhen selecting fonts and typography for your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nAre the fonts you’re using accessible? The Water Boards recommends that all fonts (including in tables and figures) must be sans serif (e.g. Arial, Calibri, Helvetica), 12 point or larger. Serif fonts (e.g. Times New Roman) and fonts sized 11 points or lower (even in captions, tables, figures, etc.) should be avoided.\nHow many different font and size combinations are being used at once? Similar to the principles outlined in the color section above, using too many different types of fonts and sizes can make the visualization or data product feel cluttered or overwhelming to the viewers. Consider consolidating your use of fonts by giving different types of information with the same level of importance the same font and size.\nDoes the text have enough space around it? Some users may have cognitive disabilities or visual impairments that results in them having trouble reading lines of text when they’re too closely spaced. By prioritizing types of cognitive accessibility through thoughtful spacing, you contribute to a more inclusive visualization or data product.\n\nFor paragraphs - give the reader at least 1.15 pt spacing within paragraphs and at least 6 pt spacing after (or between) each paragraph.\nFor lists - if the list contains only a few words on each line, 1.15 pt spacing may be sufficient. If each item in the list has multiple lines of text, treat it as you would a paragraph and use 1.15 pt spacing within each list and at least 3 pt spacing after (or between) each item in the list.\nFor items within a chart - make sure the default spacing is sufficient. If items feel cramped, see if you can add spacing among items or reduce the amount of text needed for that particular item (e.g. shorten the title so it’s only a few words on a single line rather that a full sentence)\nSpecific recommendations the World Wide Web Consortium Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 on Text Spacing include:\n\nLine height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;\nSpacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;\nLetter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;\nWord spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.\n\n\n\nTools to help with fonts & typography include:\n\nUrban Institute Data Visualization Style Guide - Chart Typography Section\n\n\n\n\nThe labels we use in our data products highlight or center the extent to which we reduce people and their experiences to components of our visualization or position and frame those same communities to live in their personal and collective power while addressing systemic oppression. Being mindful of the labels we use in our data products can help us connect and build trust with the communities that the data represents.\nWhen selecting the labels for your visualization or data product:\n\nUse clear and concise labels.\nUse full labels such as “Black people” rather than “Black.”\nAvoid using labels that reinforce stereotypes or inequitable or unjust norms.\nWhen describing people from certain demographics, use descriptors that reflect the preferences of the communities it represents as much as you can.\n\nLanguage continues to evolve. Certain labels that may have been acceptable years ago may no longer be, and we should adjust our labeling accordingly. The UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup notes that, for consistency and clarity, the data descriptors should match the categories used during data collection. However, if the data source you’re using has outdated language, updated language should be used in the label, and the outdated language can be noted in tooltips, comments, or footnotes of your visualization.\n\nBe mindful of how labels are ordered. Ordering items as they appear in the data may reflect and reinforce historical biases. The Urban Institute Do No Harm Guide recommends considering alternative sorting parameters such as study focus, specific story or argument, quantitative relationship (i.e., magnitude of the results), alphabetical, or sample size (weighted or unweighted).\n\n\n\n\nHow we layout the different components of our visualizations and data products - like color and typography - guides the reader through the their experience with said product. The order in which we present things establishes a hierarchy among elements that can indicate what we deem as important, significant or most valuable within product.\nWhen selecting the layout of the different components of your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nDoes the structure of your visualization resonate with how your audience sees the aspects of the data? \nAre you including (or excluding) elements arbitrarily or by default? Think about what would be meaningful to include (or not) for your audience. Are you adding items that don’t add value or context to the data story? If so, consider removing them. Are you removing items out of habit that should actually be included? If so, consider adding them.\nAre your captions, legends, and notes in intuitive locations?\n\nCaptions should go above tables, but below charts, images, and figures.\nLegends should stretch across the top of the chart, or to the right to make it easier for the viewer to orient themselves to the information in the product. \nNotes about a specific item (e.g. table, chart) should go below the item (and its caption, as applicable).\nFootnotes should go at the bottom of the page and only include crucial contextual information that is not explained elsewhere.\n\n\nWhen ordering different components of your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nAre data and categories ordered with intention and in a way that does not perpetuate historical biases? Which group(s) we choose to list first in figures, tables, and legends can influence how relationships and hierarchies are perceived.\n\nThe Urban Institute notes that, always starting with “White” or “Men” can make these groups appear as the default against which other groups should be compared, suggesting they’re the most important populations. How we choose to order may also reflect who we view as the intended audience for our visualizations. Starting with “White” or “Men” can make it seem as though those are the most important groups we are trying to communicate with.\n\nThe Urban Institute Do No Harm Guide recommends considering alternative sorting parameters for data, tables, and graphs such as:\n\nDoes your study focus on a particular community? If it does, that group should be presented first.\nIs there a particular argument or story you are trying to tell? If so, the order or presentation of results should reflect that argument.\nIs there a quantitative relationship that can guide how the groups are ordered? Can they be sorted alphabetically or by population size, sample size (weighted or unweighted), or magnitude or effect of the results?\n\n\n\n\n\nMaps can be powerful and intuitive ways to give place to the data you’re using in your visualization. However, just like all other visualizations, a map with points, lines, or polygons and zero context is not helpful and can actually be counter productive.\nWhen thinking about and building your map, consider:\n\nIs showing your geographic data on a map the best way to get your message across? The Urban Institute notes that at times, there may be more efficient forms of storytelling (other than maps) that can get your point across more clearly. Specifically, if your data shows a very clear geographic trend or if the absolute location of a place or event matters, maps might be the best approach, but sometimes the reflexive impulse to map the data can make you forget that showing the data in another form might answer other—and sometimes more important—questions. Consider using other graphic types when the interesting patterns are not geographic patterns, or when the geographic data is more effective for analysis than for presentation for your audience (i.e., a simple bar chart, column chart, scatterplot or table).\nIs the map projection you’re using appropriate?\n\nSimple interactive county- or state-level maps also use the Albers projection.\nUS maps for print publication, or use in reports should use the Albers Equal Area projection.\nZoomable tile-based interactive maps use the Mercator projection.\nNote that how a map is projected can influence the story being told, who is centered, and who is valued by the viewed, especially as you scale up. A great example of how map projections can impact our perception is summarized in the below clip from The West Wing. This Forbes article summarizes the scene well: The White House Press Secretary C.J. Gregg (Allison Janney) grants an audience to a group of socially minded cartographers on a noble mission: to convince the President to officially adopt a new global map that is more respectful of Third World countries. The group explains why conventional world maps are wrong and, worse, how this leads to misguided social perspectives that extend far beyond geography.\n\n\nIs the geography you’re using to visualize the data appropriate? The considerations we outlined above about grouping data also apply here, with an added geographic context, since the geography you use in your map (e.g., zip codes, census tracts, counties, watersheds, regions, etc.) will impact how the audience interacts with the map or visualization. The UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup notes that, zip codes may be convenient and readily available, but they represent expedient routes for postal delivery, not “natural” communities. This can cause analysis that disguises disparities, such as the example in Flint made by Sadler (2019).\nIs the color on the map effective? Maps tend to have more colors involved by nature (i.e. because of the inclusion of base maps, etc.). Take special care to adopt the considerations about color outlined above to ensure the map, data, and story you’re trying to tell are as accessible as possible.\n\nTools to help with map development include:\n\nState of Minnesota Map Accessibility Page – provides information on best practices for accessibility in static maps, web maps and applications.\nNon-exhaustive list of ESRI resources:\n\nAccessible Web Mapping Apps – recording from the 2020 ESRI Developer Summit\nESRI ArcGIS Accessibility Showcase (requires ESRI login)\nESRI GitHub Accessibility Repository – information on making AGOL/Portal maps accessible\nWeb Accessibility Best Practices – slides from 2019 ESRI GeoDev Webinar\nImprove accessibility of your Story Map by adding alternative text – ESRI blog post\nArcGIS Web AppBuilder accessibility support documentation\nArcGIS Social Equity Analysis tool documentation\nArcGIS Online Tips & Best Practices to Extend the Reach of your GIS\nArcGIS Hub guidance on improving the display of your content on a site and in search results\nArcGIS, ISO and INSPIRE Content Category recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to color, the shapes and icons we use in our our data visualizations or other data products can help the audience connect with the data, but we need to be thoughtful about what shapes and icons we use, how we use them, and how they may be perceived to avoid unintentionally perpetuating stereotypes or creating hierarchies.\nWhen selecting shapes and icons for your visualization or data product, consider the recommendations from the UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup and the Urban Institute Do No Harm Guide:\n\nAvoid reinforcing stereotypes (e.g., a woman as a nurse but a man as a doctor). Mis- or underrepresentation of certain groups in imagery and iconography fails to take a racial or gender equity awareness perspective toward our data visualization work and can reinforce and perpetuate stereotypes. A 2018 study by the Pew Research Center found that:\n\nImage results for common job searches overrepresent men relative to women - an estimated 60% of the individuals that appeared in the image results were men (40% were women).\nFor more than half the tested job categories, images appearing in searches underrepresent women relative to their actual participation in those jobs\nImages containing women appear further down the page in search results for many jobs.\n\nAvoid discriminatory and racist imagery.\nUse images that show people as empowered and dignified, and avoid images that depict people as helpless victims\nWhen showing groups of people, we should consider a mix of genders, races, ethnicities, and abilities.\n\nTools to help with icon selection include:\n\nTips for designing icons that depict gender from Noun Project’s lead content curator Erika Kim\n\n\n\n\nMany data visualization applications enable data practitioners to display a visualization (chart, map) alongside a table. Including or embedding tables in a visualization can increases transparency and enable users to dig into the data behind the visualization without leaving said product. However, like every other design consideration we’ve discussed, the inclusion of tables should be considered with care.\nWhen determining how you will include table(s) in your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nIs including a table helpful or does it cause confusion? If the visualization is busy by itself, including a table that shows the exact same information can add to information overwhelm. If tables and figures/maps are not linked, adding filters in one place and then not seeing those same filters applied elsewhere can cause confusion. If this is the case for your visualization & table combination, consider excluding the table from the visualization to better focus on the story and instead make it easy for viewers to download the data to view outside of the visualization, or include the table in the visualization application but on a different tab (so it’s there, but not distracting).\nWhat information should be added to the caption to make interpretation of the table easier for viewers? While the data may make perfect sense to you, remember that is likely because you have invested hours of your time to collect, process, analyze, and visualize the data. This makes it easy for the you to quickly glance at the table(s) and figure(s) within the visualization and “instinctively” know what the viewers are supposed to take away. Your audience likely doesn’t have the time (or interest) to invest as you have, and forcing them to do so will only result in loss of interest and use of the resource. ALWAYS include a caption above the table to make it easier for users to quickly orient themselves to the information included in the table, and understand how the table contributes to or backs up the story you’re trying to tell. The caption should describe the table using as much detail as needed to make it a stand-alone object (i.e. viewers should not need to read the body text or other parts of the visualization or application to understand the table).\nAre table notes needed to increase clarity? Preferably, most of the text associated with a table is in the table caption. However, if it is necessary to include notes that are associated with the table that are separate from the caption, be sure to keep them simple and only include crucial contextual information that is not explained elsewhere.\nAre the data shown in the table essential to the story? If you’ve followed the guidance in the Data Processing step, then the data you use to create the visualization or data product should be tidy. Depending on the story you’re trying to tell and the audience you’re trying to connect with, including ALL of columns and rows of the processed data within visualization can be helpful or overwhelming. Consider only displaying the essential rows and columns within the visualization and making the complete dataset available for download.\n\nIf you’re unsure of what columns or rows are essential - try asking a colleague or project partner to listen to you (or a screen reader) read the first couple of lines of the table aloud to them BEFORE they look at the table and caption. Then, have them look at the table and caption and ask which pieces of the table should be added or removed to make the desired meaning more clear.\n\nIs highlighting being used to convey information? Screen readers do not tell the viewer the color of a cell. So, do not use color or shading alone to convey data or information. Authors may use color to improve the esthetics of a table, but if the color is representative of data or information, it should be coupled by text, symbols, or data that also convey that information so that those with color vision differences can access the information you’re trying to convey.\nWhat do blank cells mean? Screen readers do not tell the viewer that a cell is blank; they just skip the cell altogether. If a blank cell has a certain meaning in your data story (e.g. NA, 0, no data, etc.), state that within the cell explicitly or add a dash ( - ) to the blank cell(s) and add a note at the bottom of the table (or within the caption) to make viewers aware of the meaning of the dash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustinmind Blog (2020) User-centered design: a beginner’s guide\nUrban Institute Resources\n\nData Visualization Style Guide\nDo No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Visualization\n\nWe All Count - Reverse Engineering Data Viz for Equity\nTEDx Talk (2014) Hardwired for story\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Water Board’s Tribal Water Data Map & Manual\nCalifornia Public Domain Allotment (PDA) Water Rights Map\nUnequal access to water: How societal factors shape vulnerability to water insecurity",

    "text": "When it comes to creating data visualizations with an equity lens, it boils down to making decisions that consider equity and inclusion in the way results are shown and communicated, and that promote accessibility of the data, information, and tool as a whole. As you develop your data visualization or equivalent application - be sure to keep the below considerations in mind and make data, communication, and design choices that support the advancement of equity, inclusion, and justice.\n\n\nConsider who the audience will be for the product you’re developing and make decisions that will prioritize their needs so they are able to easily and efficiently use, engage and interact with the product.\n\n\n\nGraphic illustrating three key components of the user-centered design process: Research, Empathy, and Iteration. Image from Justinmind (2020)\n\n\nResearch - Let’s use an equity lens here. Instead of “researching” your users and audience, try getting to know them by prioritizing relationship and trust building through meaningful engagement. Ideally, by the time you’re at this data visualization phase, you have already identified the audience and key partners, and have been working or engaging with them during other phases of the project. See the Planning section on collecting expert input for more guidance on outreach and engagement.\nEmpathy - According to Dr. Brené Brown: empathy is about feeling WITH people, and requires four qualities:\n\nPerspective taking and believing the other person when they share their experience with you\nStaying out of judgement and listening\nRecognizing emotion in another person that you have maybe felt before\nCommunicating that you can recognize that emotion\n\nIntegrating empathy into our data-intensive work requires us to consider how our audience and/or the communities whose data are being used will perceive or be impacted by our work. It means ensuring we’re developing the product and thinking about the data as more than mere points on a map or visualization, but as representing real humans, environments, and conditions that should be contextualized and considered with care. Some questions to consider include:\n\nWho is vulnerable in this context and how would they want to be counted?\nWhat information would they need to improve their lives?\nWho is undercounted or possibly missing entirely?\nWho was counted? Who did the counting? Why were they asking these people?\nWho benefits or is harmed if you forget the dots are people?\n\nIteration - The key here is knowing and planning for an iterative process from the beginning. Add the feedback, implementation, and testing loop(s) into your project plan and allocate appropriate time and resources to adequately support each step. When working with partners or communities using an iterative approach, be sure to consider:\n\nWhen it is appropriate to ask for feedback, and when it might be burdensome?\nWhat are the different ways feedback might be gathered? We might think sending an email with a poll or survey linked is the easiest, but our partner might find it easier to talk through questions over the phone with you. Knowing which method(s) to use comes with time and relationship. When in doubt - ask for what people prefer and do your best to accommodate those needs.\nHow much time is adequate for folks to be able to review what you send them and provide their feedback? When in doubt - plan for a longer feedback period than you think might be needed and confirm timelines with your partners (and adjust them if you can when your partners indicate more or less time is needed)\n\n\n\n\nCentering racial equity means paying attention to how to most effectively convey information to the audience, and insuring that the content is using plain, accessible, and inclusive language.\nPlain Language - Plain language is writing designed to ensure the audience can understand what you’re trying to communicate as easily, quickly, and comprehensively as possible. This means:\n\nAvoiding convoluted or verbose language\nAvoiding the use of jargon and acronyms\nMaking critical information easy to see and understand\nUsing a conversational rather than legal or bureaucratic tone\n\nFor more guidance on plain language, see:\n\nCenter for Plain Language\nPlainLanguage.gov\nWater Boards Staff may also request plain language review from the Office of Public Participation, although that service is more geared towards the review of fact sheets, brochures, and FAQs rather than data visualizations or other data products at this time.\nHealthy Watershed Partnership Guidance on Communicating Results\n\nAccessible Language - Making language accessible to your audience may also require the translation of products (or product components) into the primary languages used by your audience. The Water Board’s Linguistic Isolation Tool can be used to help understand the different languages that are used by communities across the state.\nWater Boards Staff may also request translation services from the Office of Public Participation, although that service is more geared towards the translation of documents, rather than data visualizations or other data products at this time.\nInclusive Language - Words matter. The language we use in our products can be a way for us to show respect, empathy, and care for the communities connected to or impacted by the data. It’s important to be mindful of the language and terms we use (see Non-Inclusive Terms to Avoid for examples). The UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup recommends we ask ourselves the following questions when we need to decide on language to use in our data products:\n\nDo the words seek to fix, blame, shame, or change communities that are most marginalized, OR do they seek to address the oppressive systems that impact these communities?\nAre the words racialized? Do the terms have a racist or colonialist implication? An example is the phrase “at risk.” Close your eyes and say the phrase “at risk.” Does a picture of a certain group or community come to mind? If so, stop and pick another word.\nIs the language people-centered? Or do the phrases objectify communities? Distinguish between calling communities a name and describing what they are experiencing. For example: “people with disabilities,” “a person with asthma,” or “communities of color.”\nHow am I framing the words? What is the context and culture we are creating and perpetuating by using the words? Are the words positioning the communities we serve to live in their personal and collective power while addressing systemic oppression?\nDo the words dehumanize the communities we serve? Words that take away agency, self-determination, or personal power and do not recognize communities’ inherent strengths and assets should be avoided.\n\n\n\n\nReview considerations provided on the Data Collection page and think through how those should be applied as you visualize and communicate the data and results of your project.\n\n\n\n\n“While data may seem cut and dry, people are not”\n- P. Kim Bui, Director of audience innovation at the Arizona Republic and author of Designing data visualisations with empathy\n\nHumans are hardwired for story. Plopping points on a map or throwing together an interactive chart without adding context is not only insufficient, its ineffective!\nTake the time to tell a story with the visualization or product you’re developing. Walk the audience through the the messages you want to convey - connect with their emotions, and back it up with the data. If you’re unsure what the story of your data is, or how to communicate it effectively, try collecting and distilling your thoughts using a COMPASS Message Box:\n\n\n\nThe COMPASS Message Box is a tool to help scientists sort and distill their (often technical or complex) knowledge in a way that will resonate with their chosen audience. Users complete the sections in any order and can then use the distilled information to communicate their science more effectively.\n\n\nEscape from the Ivory Tower: A Guide to Making Your Science Matter (Baron, 2010) is another great science communication resource.",

    "text": "This section walks through the different design decisions data practitioners must think through when developing a data visualization or similar data product, and provides recommendations on how to approach the work through a lens of accessibility, equity, and inclusion.\nData visualization design is composed of a series of compromises: Complexity vs Clarity. Depth vs. Speed. Pretty vs. Practical. The best visualizations maximize all of these, but usually, you have to prioritize some things over others. When designing a data visualization or similar data communication product, data practitioners should make decisions with their audience and equity in mind and do their best to follow the recommendations below to make the final data product as accessible and inclusive as possible.\n\n\nAlt Text is descriptive text, usually associated with images or figures, that conveys the meaning and context of the item. When creating alt text, remember:\n\nIt should complement the caption and not replicate it\nUse language to describe what the audience should take away from looking at the item\nIf there is text in the item, that text should be spelled out in the alt text\n\nTest to see if your alt text is effective by asking a colleague or project partner to listen to you (or a screen reader - see below) read the text aloud to them BEFORE they look at the item. Then, have them look at the item and ask if there are other details about the item that stand out to them as contributing to the meaning behind the item. If there are, add them in!\nScreen readers are computer software that read the text aloud and include programs like NVDA, JAWS, Acrobat, Word. A screen reader may already be integrated into your data visualization tool - if not, NVDA is free to download and is the Water Boards standard.\n\n\n\nColor can be a powerful communicator that should be selected purposefully. If we aren’t intentional with the colors we choose we may be unintentionally perpetuating stereotypes, creating hierarchies, or using color palettes that are not accessible to those with color vision differences.\nWhen selecting colors for your visualization or data product, consider the recommendations from the UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup and the Urban Institute Data Visualization Style Guide:\n\nSelect the color palettes according to the message you’re trying to convey:\n\nCategorical palettes are best when you want to distinguish discrete chunks of data that do not have an inherent ordering. It’s best to use a palette that has bold, contrasting, non-gradient colors.\nSequential palettes are best when data range from relatively low or uninteresting values to relatively high or interesting values. It’s best to use a palette that has a relatively subtle shift in hue accompanied by a large shift in brightness and saturation.\n\nAvoid reinforcing stereotypes (e.g. using pink to represent female populations, and blue to represent male populations, using colors associated with skin tones or racial stereotypes).\nWhen thinking about demographic data:\n\nNot using color to differentiate between demographic groups helps avoid unintentionally creating a hierarchy between groups and reinforcing stereotypes, and instead enables color to be used to highlight group differences and assist with interpreting the data.\nIf color is determined to be necessary to differentiate between groups, the palette should be chosen carefully. Avoid using incremental color palettes (e.g., light to dark) to represent different demographic groups. Bold and contrasting, non-gradient color palettes are a best practice when displaying demographic data and incorporating color.\nConsider plotting data disaggregated by race or ethnicity in their own separate charts, instead of plotting all disaggregated groups together in a single chart.\n\nPlotting all groups on the same chart encourages comparison using a “deficit-based perspective” that focuses attention on what low-performing / worse off groups are lacking when compared with the high performing / better off groups.\nPlotting a set of small multiples faceted by each racial or ethnic group can better encourage viewers to think about the specific needs and challenges facing each group.\n\n\nAvoid using red to green color combinations. Daltonism (i.e., Dichromacy) is the most common type of color vision difference, affecting up to 1 in 12 males (8%) and 1 in 200 females (0.5%), and it makes certain shades of green look more red.\nDo not use color or shading alone to convey data or information. Instead pair color with patterns, textures, or shapes to convey data or information.\nAvoid using too many colors, shapes, and/or patterns at the same time. Our brains can really only hold (or effectively understand) three to five complex concepts at once. If you need to use six or more colors to represent the data - it might feel cluttered or overwhelming to the viewers. Consider consolidating categories or breaking up the chart into multiple smaller charts as described above.\nA 3:1 contrast ratio is required for figures if a person must perceive a graphic in order to understand the content (e.g., colored lines in graphs, points on maps). However, text that is embedded in a graphic must meet a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 unless the text is incidental or there is no way of presenting the graphic with sufficient contrast without undermining the meaning. Use the Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA) or equivalent software to determine if the figure meets the ratio requirements.\n\nTools to help with color selection may already be integrated into your data visualization tools - if not, some other resources include:\n\nColor Brewer – tool to help create accessible color schemes for maps\nNon-exhaustive list of color vision difference simulators – Color Oracle, Coblis\nNon-exhaustive list of color palette packages for R – Base R Color Palette Guide, RColorBrewer, rcartocolor, viridis\nPaletton – tool to help explore colors and palettes\nWebAIM – color contract checker\n\n\n\n\nAs data practitioners, you decide how your audience will be able to view the data through your visualization or data product. While we might think that data are objective (spoiler - they’re not), how they’re presented impacts how they’re interpreted, perceived, and ultimately valued and acted upon. How we present the data impacts which stories we tell (or don’t tell).\nThe graphic below, from Data Feminism, illustrates how the same data can tell different stories depending on their presentation. The graphic on the left tells a story of how the unemployment has fallen substantially since it’s recent peak and might be interpreted as “good news”. The graphic on the right tells a story of how the unemployment rate has been consistently above 8% for a long time period and might be interpreted as “bad news”.\n\n\n\nTwo figures presenting the same data in different ways. Graphic from Data Feminism\n\n\nWhen selecting figure or chart types for your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nHow does the chart you use frame or present the data? What is the context and culture we are creating and perpetuating by presenting the data in that way? Are the charts we’re using positioning the communities we serve to live in their personal and collective power while addressing systemic oppression?\nIs the chart used appropriate for the data you want to display? Think about your variables (string/categorical and numeric), the volume of data, and the question you are attempting to answer or the story you’re trying to tell through the visualization or data product.\nWill the chart type be easily interpreted by the audience? Sometimes data practitioners might be inclined to use a complex chart so we can display more data at once (or just because we think it’s cool!). In moments like these, remember the words of Leonardo da Vinci — “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Think about what will be the most easy to understand and impactful for your audience.\nHow can I use the textual components of the chart (i.e., title, axis and other labels, legend, notes, caption, tooltips) to communicate simply and with clarity? More is not always more here. If context is provided elsewhere in the visualization or data product, maybe the title, caption, or tooltips are redundant. If there is only one data category that can be described by the title or caption, maybe a legend is not necessary. Think about what is essential and what can be removed or omitted to improve your clarity and communication.\nHow can other chart components (i.e. gridlines, axis lines/ticks, scales, spacing) be used to communicate simply and with clarity? If you have a lot of data on the chart - do gridlines help make sense of things, or cause confusion and clutter? Are there enough empty or negative spaces in the chart so that viewers are given the “visual breathing room” needed to easily absorb the messages you’re hoping the data conveys?\n\nTools to help with chart selection include:\n\nCool Infographics Data Visualization Guides – collection of data visualization chart choosers, reference guides, cheat sheets, websites and infographics about data visualization design best practices.\n\n\n\n\nThe fonts and typography we use determine how easy (or not) it is for the audience to efficiently read and comprehend whatever it is you’re trying to communicate. Typography (the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed) within a chart and visualization is a way to establish a hierarchy among elements within the visualization or data product and guides the reader through the visual product.\nWhen selecting fonts and typography for your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nAre the fonts you’re using accessible? The Water Boards recommends that all fonts (including in tables and figures) must be sans serif (e.g. Arial, Calibri, Helvetica), 12 point or larger. Serif fonts (e.g. Times New Roman) and fonts sized 11 points or lower (even in captions, tables, figures, etc.) should be avoided.\nHow many different font and size combinations are being used at once? Similar to the principles outlined in the color section above, using too many different types of fonts and sizes can make the visualization or data product feel cluttered or overwhelming to the viewers. Consider consolidating your use of fonts by giving different types of information with the same level of importance the same font and size.\nDoes the text have enough space around it? Some users may have cognitive disabilities or visual impairments that results in them having trouble reading lines of text when they’re too closely spaced. By prioritizing types of cognitive accessibility through thoughtful spacing, you contribute to a more inclusive visualization or data product.\n\nFor paragraphs - give the reader at least 1.15 pt spacing within paragraphs and at least 6 pt spacing after (or between) each paragraph.\nFor lists - if the list contains only a few words on each line, 1.15 pt spacing may be sufficient. If each item in the list has multiple lines of text, treat it as you would a paragraph and use 1.15 pt spacing within each list and at least 3 pt spacing after (or between) each item in the list.\nFor items within a chart - make sure the default spacing is sufficient. If items feel cramped, see if you can add spacing among items or reduce the amount of text needed for that particular item (e.g. shorten the title so it’s only a few words on a single line rather that a full sentence)\nSpecific recommendations the World Wide Web Consortium Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 on Text Spacing include:\n\nLine height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;\nSpacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;\nLetter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;\nWord spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.\n\n\n\nTools to help with fonts & typography include:\n\nUrban Institute Data Visualization Style Guide - Chart Typography Section\n\n\n\n\nThe labels we use in our data products highlight or center the extent to which we reduce people and their experiences to components of our visualization or position and frame those same communities to live in their personal and collective power while addressing systemic oppression. Being mindful of the labels we use in our data products can help us connect and build trust with the communities that the data represents.\nWhen selecting the labels for your visualization or data product:\n\nUse clear and concise labels.\nUse full labels such as “Black people” rather than “Black.”\nAvoid using labels that reinforce stereotypes or inequitable or unjust norms.\nWhen describing people from certain demographics, use descriptors that reflect the preferences of the communities it represents as much as you can.\n\nLanguage continues to evolve. Certain labels that may have been acceptable years ago may no longer be, and we should adjust our labeling accordingly. The UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup notes that, for consistency and clarity, the data descriptors should match the categories used during data collection. However, if the data source you’re using has outdated language, updated language should be used in the label, and the outdated language can be noted in tooltips, comments, or footnotes of your visualization.\n\nBe mindful of how labels are ordered. Ordering items as they appear in the data may reflect and reinforce historical biases. The Urban Institute Do No Harm Guide recommends considering alternative sorting parameters such as study focus, specific story or argument, quantitative relationship (i.e., magnitude of the results), alphabetical, or sample size (weighted or unweighted).\n\n\n\n\nHow we layout the different components of our visualizations and data products - like color and typography - guides the reader through the their experience with said product. The order in which we present things establishes a hierarchy among elements that can indicate what we deem as important, significant or most valuable within product.\nWhen selecting the layout of the different components of your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nDoes the structure of your visualization resonate with how your audience sees the aspects of the data? \nAre you including (or excluding) elements arbitrarily or by default? Think about what would be meaningful to include (or not) for your audience. Are you adding items that don’t add value or context to the data story? If so, consider removing them. Are you removing items out of habit that should actually be included? If so, consider adding them.\nAre your captions, legends, and notes in intuitive locations?\n\nCaptions should go above tables, but below charts, images, and figures.\nLegends should stretch across the top of the chart, or to the right to make it easier for the viewer to orient themselves to the information in the product. \nNotes about a specific item (e.g. table, chart) should go below the item (and its caption, as applicable).\nFootnotes should go at the bottom of the page and only include crucial contextual information that is not explained elsewhere.\n\n\nWhen ordering different components of your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nAre data and categories ordered with intention and in a way that does not perpetuate historical biases? Which group(s) we choose to list first in figures, tables, and legends can influence how relationships and hierarchies are perceived.\n\nThe Urban Institute notes that, always starting with “White” or “Men” can make these groups appear as the default against which other groups should be compared, suggesting they’re the most important populations. How we choose to order may also reflect who we view as the intended audience for our visualizations. Starting with “White” or “Men” can make it seem as though those are the most important groups we are trying to communicate with.\n\nThe Urban Institute Do No Harm Guide recommends considering alternative sorting parameters for data, tables, and graphs such as:\n\nDoes your study focus on a particular community? If it does, that group should be presented first.\nIs there a particular argument or story you are trying to tell? If so, the order or presentation of results should reflect that argument.\nIs there a quantitative relationship that can guide how the groups are ordered? Can they be sorted alphabetically or by population size, sample size (weighted or unweighted), or magnitude or effect of the results?\n\n\n\n\n\nMaps can be powerful and intuitive ways to give place to the data you’re using in your visualization. However, just like all other visualizations, a map with points, lines, or polygons and zero context is not helpful and can actually be counter productive.\nWhen thinking about and building your map, consider:\n\nIs showing your geographic data on a map the best way to get your message across? The Urban Institute notes that at times, there may be more efficient forms of storytelling (other than maps) that can get your point across more clearly. Specifically, if your data shows a very clear geographic trend or if the absolute location of a place or event matters, maps might be the best approach, but sometimes the reflexive impulse to map the data can make you forget that showing the data in another form might answer other—and sometimes more important—questions. Consider using other graphic types when the interesting patterns are not geographic patterns, or when the geographic data is more effective for analysis than for presentation for your audience (i.e., a simple bar chart, column chart, scatterplot or table).\nIs the map projection you’re using appropriate?\n\nSimple interactive county- or state-level maps also use the Albers projection.\nUS maps for print publication, or use in reports should use the Albers Equal Area projection.\nZoomable tile-based interactive maps use the Mercator projection.\nNote that how a map is projected can influence the story being told, who is centered, and who is valued by the viewed, especially as you scale up. A great example of how map projections can impact our perception is summarized in the below clip from The West Wing. This Forbes article summarizes the scene well: The White House Press Secretary C.J. Gregg (Allison Janney) grants an audience to a group of socially minded cartographers on a noble mission: to convince the President to officially adopt a new global map that is more respectful of Third World countries. The group explains why conventional world maps are wrong and, worse, how this leads to misguided social perspectives that extend far beyond geography.\n\n\nIs the geography you’re using to visualize the data appropriate? The considerations we outlined above about grouping data also apply here, with an added geographic context, since the geography you use in your map (e.g., zip codes, census tracts, counties, watersheds, regions, etc.) will impact how the audience interacts with the map or visualization. The UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup notes that, zip codes may be convenient and readily available, but they represent expedient routes for postal delivery, not “natural” communities. This can cause analysis that disguises disparities, such as the example in Flint made by Sadler (2019).\nIs the color on the map effective? Maps tend to have more colors involved by nature (i.e. because of the inclusion of base maps, etc.). Take special care to adopt the considerations about color outlined above to ensure the map, data, and story you’re trying to tell are as accessible as possible.\n\nTools to help with map development include:\n\nState of Minnesota Map Accessibility Page – provides information on best practices for accessibility in static maps, web maps and applications.\nNon-exhaustive list of ESRI resources:\n\nAccessible Web Mapping Apps – recording from the 2020 ESRI Developer Summit\nESRI ArcGIS Accessibility Showcase (requires ESRI login)\nESRI GitHub Accessibility Repository – information on making AGOL/Portal maps accessible\nWeb Accessibility Best Practices – slides from 2019 ESRI GeoDev Webinar\nImprove accessibility of your Story Map by adding alternative text – ESRI blog post\nArcGIS Web AppBuilder accessibility support documentation\nArcGIS Social Equity Analysis tool documentation\nArcGIS Online Tips & Best Practices to Extend the Reach of your GIS\nArcGIS Hub guidance on improving the display of your content on a site and in search results\nArcGIS, ISO and INSPIRE Content Category recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to color, the shapes and icons we use in our our data visualizations or other data products can help the audience connect with the data, but we need to be thoughtful about what shapes and icons we use, how we use them, and how they may be perceived to avoid unintentionally perpetuating stereotypes or creating hierarchies.\nWhen selecting shapes and icons for your visualization or data product, consider the recommendations from the UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup and the Urban Institute Do No Harm Guide:\n\nAvoid reinforcing stereotypes (e.g., a woman as a nurse but a man as a doctor). Mis- or underrepresentation of certain groups in imagery and iconography fails to take a racial or gender equity awareness perspective toward our data visualization work and can reinforce and perpetuate stereotypes. A 2018 study by the Pew Research Center found that:\n\nImage results for common job searches overrepresent men relative to women - an estimated 60% of the individuals that appeared in the image results were men (40% were women).\nFor more than half the tested job categories, images appearing in searches underrepresent women relative to their actual participation in those jobs\nImages containing women appear further down the page in search results for many jobs.\n\nAvoid discriminatory and racist imagery.\nUse images that show people as empowered and dignified, and avoid images that depict people as helpless victims\nWhen showing groups of people, we should consider a mix of genders, races, ethnicities, and abilities.\n\nTools to help with icon selection include:\n\nTips for designing icons that depict gender from Noun Project’s lead content curator Erika Kim\n\n\n\n\nMany data visualization applications enable data practitioners to display a visualization (chart, map) alongside a table. Including or embedding tables in a visualization can increases transparency and enable users to dig into the data behind the visualization without leaving said product. However, like every other design consideration we’ve discussed, the inclusion of tables should be considered with care.\nWhen determining how you will include table(s) in your visualization or data product, consider:\n\nIs including a table helpful or does it cause confusion? If the visualization is busy by itself, including a table that shows the exact same information can add to information overwhelm. If tables and figures/maps are not linked, adding filters in one place and then not seeing those same filters applied elsewhere can cause confusion. If this is the case for your visualization & table combination, consider excluding the table from the visualization to better focus on the story and instead make it easy for viewers to download the data to view outside of the visualization, or include the table in the visualization application but on a different tab (so it’s there, but not distracting).\nWhat information should be added to the caption to make interpretation of the table easier for viewers? While the data may make perfect sense to you, remember that is likely because you have invested hours of your time to collect, process, analyze, and visualize the data. This makes it easy for the you to quickly glance at the table(s) and figure(s) within the visualization and “instinctively” know what the viewers are supposed to take away. Your audience likely doesn’t have the time (or interest) to invest as you have, and forcing them to do so will only result in loss of interest and use of the resource. ALWAYS include a caption above the table to make it easier for users to quickly orient themselves to the information included in the table, and understand how the table contributes to or backs up the story you’re trying to tell. The caption should describe the table using as much detail as needed to make it a stand-alone object (i.e. viewers should not need to read the body text or other parts of the visualization or application to understand the table).\nAre table notes needed to increase clarity? Preferably, most of the text associated with a table is in the table caption. However, if it is necessary to include notes that are associated with the table that are separate from the caption, be sure to keep them simple and only include crucial contextual information that is not explained elsewhere.\nAre the data shown in the table essential to the story? If you’ve followed the guidance in the Data Processing step, then the data you use to create the visualization or data product should be tidy. Depending on the story you’re trying to tell and the audience you’re trying to connect with, including ALL of columns and rows of the processed data within visualization can be helpful or overwhelming. Consider only displaying the essential rows and columns within the visualization and making the complete dataset available for download.\n\nIf you’re unsure of what columns or rows are essential - try asking a colleague or project partner to listen to you (or a screen reader) read the first couple of lines of the table aloud to them BEFORE they look at the table and caption. Then, have them look at the table and caption and ask which pieces of the table should be added or removed to make the desired meaning more clear.\n\nIs highlighting being used to convey information? Screen readers do not tell the viewer the color of a cell. So, do not use color or shading alone to convey data or information. Authors may use color to improve the esthetics of a table, but if the color is representative of data or information, it should be coupled by text, symbols, or data that also convey that information so that those with color vision differences can access the information you’re trying to convey.\nWhat do blank cells mean? Screen readers do not tell the viewer that a cell is blank; they just skip the cell altogether. If a blank cell has a certain meaning in your data story (e.g. NA, 0, no data, etc.), state that within the cell explicitly or add a dash ( - ) to the blank cell(s) and add a note at the bottom of the table (or within the caption) to make viewers aware of the meaning of the dash.",

Documentation in our data-intensive workflows can also help identify areas of improvement in how we work with ourselves and others, and make it easier to identify solutions to project sticking points and create other paths forward. Moreover, clear documentation allows us to pick up where we left off, or easily transition projects from one person or team to another when roles change thus preventing the loss of incredibly valuable institutional knowledge that only comes with time and experience. Without proper documentation, it can be difficult for others to have confidence in, ground truth/validate, or build on existing work.\nIndividuals and teams that invest the time to create clear and complete documentation tend to find projects to be a bit more manageable because they have resources to guide them. Over the long-term, that investment into clear and comprehensive documentation can increase the reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility of their work.

Illustration adapted from LaneFour\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are abundantly clear benefits to ourselves, our teams, and our partners when we invest in comprehensive and clear documentation. As you embark on your documentation journey, be sure to also consider what documentation would be helpful for others outside of your normal or core project team, keep the below considerations in mind, and remember to document with an equity lens.\nReproducibility: Reproducibility is a vital aspect of documentation that plays a key role in advancing and operationalizing equity into our data-intensive work. When our work is documented in a way that allows ourselves and others to replicate process and findings, it ensures that folks can access and validate the data as part of their understanding and workflows.\nTransparency: Transparency in documentation is particularly vital for building trust with communities that have historically and to this day experience a lack of openness or consideration by government. By prioritizing transparent documentation, we can clearly communicate and connect the dots for folks when it comes to how we work, what data and methods we use, what that data tells us and the reasoning and actions we take throughout our processes, thus better enabling communities to understand how and why we make certain decisions and how all of that may impact them and others. This openness can empower current and potential future partners and communities to engage meaningfully with our work, ensuring that their voices are respected and needs are considered in ongoing and future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen and Transparent Doesn’t Always Mean Public\n\n\n\nWhile we want to make as much of our process and products open and transparent as possible, this does not mean the EVERYTHING should be made public. It’s important to balance the need to keep confidential and private information secure while also making process and products open, transparent, and publicly available. This balance varies by project.\nWhat’s important is for teams to discuss what this balance looks like for them and act, document, and share accordingly.\n\n\nAccessibility: When our is projects, process, and products are presented in ways that center accessibility— such as offering offline materials, using multiple languages, or documenting in plain language — it lowers barriers and makes it easier for individuals to participate and engage. Prioritizing accessibility in our documentation not only increases access to vital information but also demonstrates a genuine commitment to inclusivity and respect for diverse experiences.\nCollaboration: If documentation exists and that documentation is comprehensive, reproducible, transparent, and accessible then (and only then!) will our projects, products, and process help us rebuild trust, repair relationships and/or begin to build new ones, which ultimately make it easier for communities to want to engage, collaborate and meaningfully contribute to our processes, or better yet, co-create products and resources with us. Prioritizing and investing in documentation, and creating it with an equity lens, can help us bridge gaps in communication and understanding, ultimately fostering trust, collaboration, and relationships with communities that have had the experience of being excluded or otherwise overlooked in our projects, products, and process.\nComprehensive documentation using an equity lens can be yet another tool we can use to operationalize equity and advance more equitable outcomes in our work.\n\n\n\nPoor documentation is rarely used or referred to after it is written, and feels like (and often is) a waste of time.\nGreat documentation is an investment that is built over time. No one documents something and gets everything down perfectly the first time. Teams with great documentation decide progress is better than perfection and make time to iteratively improve, build on, and evolve what is documented over time so that it continues to be comprehensive and useful beyond when it was first drafted. This is why it’s critical for teams to think through:\n\nwhat the team will document\nhow documentation will be developed\nwhere documentation will be stored\nhow it will be shared (or not)\nwho will be responsible for creating and maintaining documentation over time\n\nWhen teams are beginning their documentation discussions and process, they should expect to document (almost) everything in some form, and plan to invest time accordingly. A list of things to consider documenting is provided in the graphic below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTrying to document everything below all at once can feel overwhelming and impossible. That’s because it is!\nRemember that perfection is the enemy of good. Focus on making iterative progress and improvements given your teams priorities, bandwidth, and capacity.\nWith time and consistent investment in documentation, your team can have everything below (and more!) documented comprehensively and in ways that advance and operationalize equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the different types of things to document for a project under four documentation categories: Team, Process, Technical, and User\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes Pathway - Join Openscapes at the Water Boards to learn more and build your Team Pathway!\nSchema.org – Promoting common data structures on the internet\nAccessibility tips using Markdown (Smashing Magazine)\nWritethedocs.org, plus a piece on documenting for beginners\nTemplates for documenting on GitHub (e.g., on a ReadMe)\nCreating and maintaining a Data Dictionary\nUS EPA Guidance for Content Item Metadata in ArcGIS Online\nDocument code through comments and #tidydata\nGitHub projects best practices\n\n\n\n\nNOAA NMFS Open Science Resources - A Compilation of Resources and Experience to Support Open Science Communities in NOAA Fisheries\nNOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox - Browse software tools for NOAA Fisheries scientific work\nNASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook - Supporting NASA Research Teams’ Migration to the Cloud\nOpenscapes Approach Guide - Guidance for Openscapes leaders on how to implement Openscapes programs and approaches",

This openness can empower current and potential future partners and communities to engage meaningfully with our work, ensuring that their voices are respected and needs are considered in ongoing and future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen and Transparent Doesn’t Always Mean Public\n\n\n\nWhile we want to make as much of our process and products open and transparent as possible, this does not mean the EVERYTHING should be made public. It’s important to balance the need to keep confidential and private information secure while also making process and products open, transparent, and publicly available. This balance varies by project.\nWhat’s important is for teams to discuss what this balance looks like for them and act, document, and share accordingly.\n\n\nAccessibility: When our is projects, process, and products are presented in ways that center accessibility— such as offering offline materials, using multiple languages, or documenting in plain language — it lowers barriers and makes it easier for individuals to participate and engage. Prioritizing accessibility in our documentation not only increases access to vital information but also demonstrates a genuine commitment to inclusivity and respect for diverse experiences.\nCollaboration: If documentation exists and that documentation is comprehensive, reproducible, transparent, and accessible then (and only then!) will our projects, products, and process help us rebuild trust, repair relationships and/or begin to build new ones, which ultimately make it easier for communities to want to engage, collaborate and meaningfully contribute to our processes, or better yet, co-create products and resources with us. Prioritizing and investing in documentation, and creating it with an equity lens, can help us bridge gaps in communication and understanding, ultimately fostering trust, collaboration, and relationships with communities that have had the experience of being excluded or otherwise overlooked in our projects, products, and process.\nComprehensive documentation using an equity lens can be yet another tool we can use to operationalize equity and advance more equitable outcomes in our work.",

No one documents something and gets everything down perfectly the first time. Teams with great documentation decide progress is better than perfection and make time to iteratively improve, build on, and evolve what is documented over time so that it continues to be comprehensive and useful beyond when it was first drafted. This is why it’s critical for teams to think through:\n\nwhat the team will document\nhow documentation will be developed\nwhere documentation will be stored\nhow it will be shared (or not)\nwho will be responsible for creating and maintaining documentation over time\n\nWhen teams are beginning their documentation discussions and process, they should expect to document (almost) everything in some form, and plan to invest time accordingly.

    "text": "By now, you’ve completed some or all of your product development steps (Data Analysis, Data Visualization) and are ready to publish and share product components. Congratulations!\nThis phase of the data life cycle involves making the project’s data and products open and accessible as appropriate.\nAlso see a short list of best practices for this phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nJust like the Preservation & Storage phase, this content should be reviewed during the Plan & Prepare Phase of your project! Depending on your project needs, you may even integrate your responses to questions below into your project’s data management plan. Doing so will make it easier for all team members to prepare their project components accordingly and will save you time when implementing this phase of the project.\n\n\n\n\nThe Water Boards typically make virtually all of the data we collect available to the public, with the exception of confidential information that should remain private and secure. As such, the openness and accessibility of your project’s data and resultant products should be in alignment with the Water Board’s Open Data Resolution: “Adopting Principles of Open Data as a Core Value and Directing Programs and Activities to Implement Strategic Actions to Improve Data Accessibility and Associated Innovation.” This means:\n\nDocumenting your process throughout the project so as to make it open, transparent, and reproducible\nUtilizing open data and open source software and tools (e.g., Python, R, GitHub) as much as possible\nMaking the data you use and code you develop transparent and accessible to the public after the project is complete, as appropriate\n\nFrom a data science lens - Making data and products open and accessible (as appropriate) increases transparency of the work and makes it easier for future project team members (including yourself!) to reference, reuse, and build upon components in the future. This will reduce the amount of time future teams need to spend looking for and reinventing proverbial wheels you already invested time in developing, thus increasing future efficiency and reproducibility and decreasing frustration and workload for all.\nFrom an equity lens - In addition to the benefits listed above, making data and products open and accessible (as appropriate) can contribute to trust building and future opportunities for collaboration between the project team, partners, and communities, enable communities and partners to use the data for their interests and needs, and empower all to take data-informed actions that ultimately advance and operationalize equity in the institutions, communities, and systems in which we all live, work, and play.\n\n\n\nWhen getting ready to publish and share components or products of your data project, it’s important to be thoughtful of how you do so. Similar to the creation of data visualizations - plopping content or products on a webpage or data portal without context or care can (at best) be unhelpful and (at worst) actually perpetuate or reinforce inequity and injustice.\nAs you embark upon this exciting phase of your project’s data life cycle, be sure to keep the below considerations in mind and make publication and sharing choices that support the advancement of equity, inclusion, and justice.\n\n\nWe’ve said it before and we’ll repeat it again here: project teams should begin communication with communities and partners at the earliest stages of project development, and continue to communicate and check-in during each phase of implementation, including during this phase. What’s critical here is to communicate with communities and partners BEFORE any content is finalized or published to get a (hopefully another) round of critical feedback on the interpretation and framing of the project and its content.\nUnfortunately, it’s not uncommon for communities - particularly those that have been excluded, marginalized, neglected and face the impacts and burden of systemic racism and injustice - to get requests for data, information, or feedback during one phase of a government project, never hear back from the project team, and then learn after something is published that what they shared has been misrepresented, miscommunicated, or even shared when it should not have been. As one might expect, this is a very easy and fast way to erode trust, burn bridges, and ruin relationships that you have invested precious time, energy, and resources to build.\nUse this time to:\n\nConnect with those you have reached out to in previous phases of the project and share your publication, sharing, and communication plans for the project. Also see the notes on iteration in the Take a user-centered design approach section for more guidance.\nIntegrate the feedback you receive into the product(s) before publishing and sharing broadly. Remember, this can take some time to implement well - plan ahead so you aren’t rushed. Also see the notes on iteration in the Take a user-centered design approach section for more guidance.\nDiscuss whether a coordinated communication strategy across community and partner institutions can/should be developed and implemented. If appropriate and communities and partners on board, this could result in all parties involved (and their media / communication teams) distributing findings and products across their respective networks in a coordinated and consistent way, thus furthering the reach and potential impact of the project.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to all of the reasons outlined in the above Why Publish & Share Data Products?section, the Urban Institute’s Principles for Advancing Equitable Data Practice notes that sharing data can reduce the burden of duplicate data collection on communities. Specifically:\n\nSome people and communities are consistently the targets of data collection and study, sometimes from organizations seeking the same information for similar purposes. Siloed data place an additional—and potentially unnecessary—burden on community members. Sharing nonconfidential data, when it is unlikely that it could lead to harm or add risks, may reduce the burden that individuals and communities experience from data collection\n\nAs you publish your project’s data and products, be sure to:\n\nPublish data and complete metadata in publicly accessible locations, such as Water Boards databases and/or the California Open Data Portal (or California State Geoportal), as appropriate. Also see the Publish Your Water Boards Data page for more guidance\nPublish or embed accessible products onto Water Boards webpages, as appropriate, including: planning or summary documents/reports, fact sheets, applications, presentation slides or recordings, etc.\nPublish any code and related software packages or products in the Water Boards GitHub, as appropriate, including: data and analysis workflow diagrams or related documentation, all application and source code files, and all data, analysis, interpretation, and visualization processing scripts. Also see the Open Source Code Handbook for more guidance.\nPublish any peer-reviewed literature in open access journals, as appropriate. Public data and records are public property, as appropriate. Therefore, any products developed by public agencies using those public resources should also be public property, as appropriate. The best way to ensure peer-reviewed literature remains accessible to the public is by publishing in open access journals or equivalent open and free to access publication avenues.\nEnsure all documentation associated with the project is written in plain, accessible, and inclusive language, as appropriate, including: metadata, ReadMe files, code comments, and anything else pertaining to the project components listed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember - Open does not always mean public\n\n\n\nThe Water Board’s Open Data Resolution urges us to make our data and products open and accessible to the public, as appropriate. Equally important is ensuring that the confidential components of our work are secured and protected appropriately. See the Data Preparation and Preservation & Storage pages for more detailed guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to all of the considerations outlined in the above Make data and products open and accessible to the public section, it’s also important to take time to make project, data, products, information and knowledge accessible to and useful for the communities and partners that contributed to or could be impacted by the project. The Urban Institute’s Principles for Advancing Equitable Data Practice notes that:\n\nAnalysts have the power to disrupt the dynamic of people’s having no ownership of and deriving no utility from what their data have produced. Ensuring that the results are communicated in a way that community members can use and understand is an important step toward equity.\n\nAs you implement other components of this phase, be sure to:\n\nConnect with those you have reached out to in previous phases of the project and walk through the data and products you plan to publish and share. Ideally, this will be wrapped into the conversations you have with these folks BEFORE publication to streamline conversations and reduce the burden of providing feedback.\nDiscuss whether the existing results and products are communicated in ways that resonate with and are useful to the community. If they are generous and able to tell you how to improve your communication, be sure to integrate that into existing products! See the Data Visualization for guidance on how to effectively communicate with data.\nDiscuss whether additional products or resources should be developed to improve communication and usefulness of the data and products for the community. It will be important to be clear about your capacity and limitations going into these conversations so you can manage expectations and only commit to actions and timelines you can realistically accomplish. Depending on what products you decide to develop, it might be helpful to co-create them with your community partners so that messaging and functionality is as useful and impactful as possible. Some products that might be considered for development include:\n\nA project fact sheet or brochure that describes the project, available resources, and what it means for the community\nA webpage update (or development of a new page) that makes it easy for communities to find the information and resources they need about the project and products\nA step by step guide, workshop, training, or video that walks people through how to use what has been developed and interpret the results or findings appropriately\nCustomized code or program that communities can use to pull data from databases and process it for their own data analysis and visualization needs\nA media and/or press kit, that would include resources for communities and partners to use to share information about the project and products, including:\n\nlanguage for press releases or social media posts, including:\n\nproject background, goals\nkey results, facts, or statistics\ncase studies\navailable resources, products, or services\ncontact details (name/email addresses, social media handles)\nrelevant hashtags\n\nfigures or images that are ready to be shared broadly, including the image titles, captions, and alt text that should accompany the use of each image\ninstructions on how to embed products into community-managed web-pages\nbranding guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you develop your media kit, be sure to work with your Water Boards Communications team to ensure all content is consistent with other Water Boards communications.\n\n\n\nAnything else communities and partners say they need to effectively use the data and products, you’ve invested time, energy, and resources to develop!",

    "text": "“Raw data, like raw potatoes, usually require cleaning before use.”\n— Ronald A. Thisted, Professor Emeritus - Departments of Statistics and Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago\n\n\n“Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”\n— Leo Tolstoy, Russian author known as one of the world’s greatest novelists.\n“Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.”\n— Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at Posit (formerly RStudio)\n\nGood data organization and formatting is the foundation of any data project. Once the data are collected, you will need to process them so they can be used in your analyses or product development steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData processing takes time - plan accordingly!\n\n\n\nIt’s commonly understood in the data science field that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data (Dasu and Johnson 2003) - expect the same will be true for your project and prepare to invest time and resources accordingly.\n\n\nThe Resources section below links to resources that provide detailed technical guidance on how to process data using data science methods. Here, we discuss the why and how we go about this step with an equity lens.\nWhen we talk about data processing here, we’re referring to the steps required to organize, format, and clean the data so it’s more efficient to use in future steps, and so others can consistently reproduce your steps - - this is commonly referred to as tidying data.\n\n\nFrom a data science lens - Investing the time to properly tidy your data upfront makes the analyses or product development steps much more efficient and reproducible. This will cut down the time it takes in the long term to complete your analysis and product development steps (even if they need to evolve/change over time!), enabling you to spend more time on the actual data, science, management, and equity questions you have for your project (aka the good stuff!).\nFrom an equity lens - having consistent and reproducible data makes it easy for others to replicate your work, which can increase transparency of your process and ultimately help build trust with your partners, the communities impacted by the management decisions associated with your project, and the public at large.\nAdditionally, working from a foundation of tidy data (and using consistent tools) can make it easier for others to collaborate with and contribute to your data project, which generally results in a better product in the end.\n\n\n\nKeep your “raw data raw”: It’s important to keep (and back up) a version of your data that is untouched by your process (i.e. raw). We also recommend backing up a version of your data that is tidied and cleaned (i.e. what you will use for analysis). Not only does doing so protect you if your working version of the data are lost for some reason (e.g., computer crash, freak system failure) - but it also helps with reproducibility and transparency of your process.\nRemove duplicate or irrelevant data: When you’re processing your data and making it tidy, think through which data from your sources are applicable to your question(s). Sometimes we don’t have the technical or logistical capacity to keep ALL of the data we are able to collect - so if you are going to remove data at this step, be sure to document WHY you’re removing it in a way that makes it easy for others to easily understand the reasoning behind the data decisions you’re making. Some reasons might include:\n\nData are outside of the geographic scope of the analysis (e.g. we’re focused on a particular region for the project, and we are removing data outside of that region so we can increase loading/analysis speeds)\nFields/columns from source data are not relevant to our analysis for XYZ reasons.\n\nTransform your data into a tidy structure: Here you will reformat or restructure your dataset so it can be used in your future analyses or product development steps in a way that is efficient, effective, and meaningful for your project’s objectives. A common data transformation at this phase is converting a dataset from wide to long formats.\n\n\n\nGraphic illustrating tidy data as a way to describe data that’s organized with a particular structure – a rectangular structure, where each variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each cell is a single measurement. Artwork by Allison Horst from the Openscapes Blog: Tidy data for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration by Julie Lowndes and Allison Horst.\n\n\nExplore your data - but don’t analyze it: Once duplicate and irrelevant data are removed from the dataset, you may want to explore your data using simple visualizations or statistics (see the Data Exploration Checklist for ideas). This will help you find extreme outliers in your data, or otherwise incorrect or missing data that should be removed, separated, corrected, substituted or imputed before you begin your data analysis phase. Similar to when you removed duplicate or irrelevant data, you will want to document WHY you’re removing/correcting/imputing these data in a way that makes it easy for others to easily understand the reasoning behind the data decisions you’re making.\nAny aggregation or preliminary analysis of your data should be completed during the analysis phase of the project. Keeping the values and aggregation of the data as they are at this phase increases reproducibility and transparency now and during future steps. Note that this is different from transforming data as described above (e.g. restructuring from wide to long format), which is a common and very useful part of the data processing phase.\nYou might be tempted to begin your data quality assessments as you’re looking at the data during this phase, but you’ll actually want to hold off on that for now. You’ll complete your data quality and assurance steps after all of your data have been tidied and you can look at all of your data holistically.\n\n\n\n\nJulia Lowndes and Allison Horst (2020) Tidy Data for reproducibility, efficiency, and collaboration.

    "text": "From a data science lens - Investing the time to properly tidy your data upfront makes the analyses or product development steps much more efficient and reproducible. This will cut down the time it takes in the long term to complete your analysis and product development steps (even if they need to evolve/change over time!), enabling you to spend more time on the actual data, science, management, and equity questions you have for your project (aka the good stuff!).\nFrom an equity lens - having consistent and reproducible data makes it easy for others to replicate your work, which can increase transparency of your process and ultimately help build trust with your partners, the communities impacted by the management decisions associated with your project, and the public at large.\nAdditionally, working from a foundation of tidy data (and using consistent tools) can make it easier for others to collaborate with and contribute to your data project, which generally results in a better product in the end.",

    "text": "Keep your “raw data raw”: It’s important to keep (and back up) a version of your data that is untouched by your process (i.e. raw). We also recommend backing up a version of your data that is tidied and cleaned (i.e. what you will use for analysis). Not only does doing so protect you if your working version of the data are lost for some reason (e.g., computer crash, freak system failure) - but it also helps with reproducibility and transparency of your process.\nRemove duplicate or irrelevant data: When you’re processing your data and making it tidy, think through which data from your sources are applicable to your question(s). Sometimes we don’t have the technical or logistical capacity to keep ALL of the data we are able to collect - so if you are going to remove data at this step, be sure to document WHY you’re removing it in a way that makes it easy for others to easily understand the reasoning behind the data decisions you’re making. Some reasons might include:\n\nData are outside of the geographic scope of the analysis (e.g. we’re focused on a particular region for the project, and we are removing data outside of that region so we can increase loading/analysis speeds)\nFields/columns from source data are not relevant to our analysis for XYZ reasons.\n\nTransform your data into a tidy structure: Here you will reformat or restructure your dataset so it can be used in your future analyses or product development steps in a way that is efficient, effective, and meaningful for your project’s objectives. A common data transformation at this phase is converting a dataset from wide to long formats.\n\n\n\nGraphic illustrating tidy data as a way to describe data that’s organized with a particular structure – a rectangular structure, where each variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each cell is a single measurement. Artwork by Allison Horst from the Openscapes Blog: Tidy data for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration by Julie Lowndes and Allison Horst.\n\n\nExplore your data - but don’t analyze it: Once duplicate and irrelevant data are removed from the dataset, you may want to explore your data using simple visualizations or statistics (see the Data Exploration Checklist for ideas). This will help you find extreme outliers in your data, or otherwise incorrect or missing data that should be removed, separated, corrected, substituted or imputed before you begin your data analysis phase. Similar to when you removed duplicate or irrelevant data, you will want to document WHY you’re removing/correcting/imputing these data in a way that makes it easy for others to easily understand the reasoning behind the data decisions you’re making.\nAny aggregation or preliminary analysis of your data should be completed during the analysis phase of the project. Keeping the values and aggregation of the data as they are at this phase increases reproducibility and transparency now and during future steps. Note that this is different from transforming data as described above (e.g. restructuring from wide to long format), which is a common and very useful part of the data processing phase.\nYou might be tempted to begin your data quality assessments as you’re looking at the data during this phase, but you’ll actually want to hold off on that for now. You’ll complete your data quality and assurance steps after all of your data have been tidied and you can look at all of your data holistically.",

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nYou should have addressed this during the Plan & Prepare phase of your process…but just in case you haven’t (yet) or you need a refresher - we’re restating here:\nAchieving racial equity outcomes means that race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved (Glossary)\nSo, as you begin to collect the data for your project, be sure it includes:\n\nData that can represent your management question(s) or project objectives.\nData that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes. This may be limited to simple demographics data - but it could also be something more! Working with Tribal and community experts to decide what type(s) of data are most applicable to and reflective of their lived experiences as they relate to your management questions and project objectives is a great place to start!\n\n\n\nThe data related to your project may come from direct human observation, laboratory and field instruments, experiments, simulations, surveys, and/or compilations of data from other sources. Below we focus on data that can be downloaded from open data sources, and survey guidance.\n\n\nAs you begin to collect the data required for your project, it’s important to remember that ALL data have limits in what they can actually tell us, constraints on how they should be used appropriately, and biases related to initial data collection or generation - and it’s crucial to be aware of and account for them during your project.\nIn addition to data limitations related to data quality or analysis methods (e.g., insufficient quality, low sample size; see the the Quality Assurance and Data Analysis pages for more details), be sure to also keep the below considerations in mind so that you can prepare and analyze your data in a way that supports the advancement of equity, inclusion, and justice.\n\n\nWe all have unconscious biases and operate in inequitable and unjust systems. That can unconsciously and unintentionally impact how data are collected and result in datasets that reflect those biases. Take time to ask the following questions about the data you’re interested in using for your project so you can have a better understanding of the data’s context and be better able to detect and account for potential biases of said data:\n\nWho collected the data?\nWhy were these specific data collected? What were the data collection goals?\nHow was data collected?\nWhat was prioritized during data collection?\nWhat assumptions were made during data collection?\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not uncommon for project teams to have gaps in data, even after all of your diligent work and investment into the planning and data preparation steps of the project. This limitation of the data may be out of your control - especially when you are using data from external sources. Quality data regarding marginalized communities is often lacking. For example, recent research has shown that US lakes are monitored disproportionately less in communities of color - similar trends may be likely in other data sources.\nWhen this happens, it’s important to acknowledge, document, and accessibly communicate those gaps and who is not adequately represented in your data product. In some cases, It may be appropriate to still present or analyze these data and also present caveats for the data limitations. In other cases, it may be more appropriate to rely only on qualitative discussion based on information derived from background research and feedback from affected communities.\n\n\n\n\nAs you collect your data, start thinking through how the raw data you are collecting is already grouped and how you intend on grouping the data. You may not be able to decide on how you will ultimately aggregate or disaggregate the data until you are further along in the analysis or visualization stages - but it’s important to begin thinking about this issue during the data collection phase for the reasons outlined below.\nHow we aggregate or disaggregate the data can impact which groups are “seen” and represented (or not) in our data products. This can also influence who is centered, valued, or prioritized in the narrative of the visualization, and who is excluded.\nCarefully consider how groups are lumped or split - by aggregating many groups in the visualization beyond what might be statistically necessary (and not acknowledging who is being grouped together and why), we can unintentionally misrepresent said groups, minimize inequities and perpetuate invisible and erased experiences of those communities. On the other hand, when analysts create a subgroup, they may be shifting the focus of analysis to a specific population that is likely already over-surveilled (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration).\nThe UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup recommends we ask ourselves the following questions when we’re thinking about how we will aggregate the data (or not):\n\nIs important data/nuance lost by combining categories? Ensure there is not a meaningful difference in our ability to understand equity outcomes between groups that would be lost if combined.\nDoes the inclusion of uncombined data negatively impact the interpretation of the data visualization? Having too many groups can make visualizations cluttered and hard to interpret. Additionally, disaggregation leads to smaller group sizes, which can make comparisons to larger groups more difficult and quantifying statistical significance more challenging. For those reasons, it can sometimes be best to combine groups.\nDoes sharing uncombined data compromise confidential information (e.g., Personal Identifiable Information) or information considered private by the community from which it comes (e.g., locations of sacred practices)? This will depend on the audience you are sharing the visualization with (e.g. internal vs public) and what information it contains.\n\nIf you ultimately decide to aggregate / combine groups, be sure to:\n\nAvoid creating a dichotomy of races. Don’t use “White” vs. “non-White” or “people of color.” Rather, disaggregate the “non-White” group to show the diversity among communities.\nBe transparent about why you’re making those decisions (including the trade offs you considered) and documenting those decisions accordingly.\nAcknowledge who is now not included in the data or visualization and explain what groups have been combined and why. Use comments, tooltips, or footnotes that can be easily accessed within the visualization to make it easier for users to find this information.\nThink carefully about how groups are lumped in the “other” category of our analysis or visualization. Sometimes it’s necessary to combine groups into a single “other” category (e.g. to generalize small groups to protect confidentiality or to achieve adequate sample size for your analysis). The Urban Institute’s Do No Harm Data Visualization Recommendations include considering alternatives to using the term “other” as a catch-all category, including:\n\nAnother ______ (e.g. Another race or Another group)\nAdditional ______ (e.g. Additional races or Additional languages)\nAll other self-descriptions\nPeople identifying as other or multiple races\nIdentity not listed\nIdentity not listed in the survey or dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, the Water Boards programs were not developed or designed to collect the types of data needed to conduct analyses with an equity lens as a matter of process which means that most will rely on a few key data sources.\nBelow we have provided a list of common data sources that can tell us something about the extent to which we are achieving equity outcomes. In addition to the open data sources below, most organizations including the Water Board have various types of Administrative Data which is internal demographics data related to the workforce in the organization. This data is normally confidential but is very valuable when working on addressing workforce equity.\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Open Data Portal\nWater Board’s Data and Databases\nCalEnviroScreen\n\nAnalysis of Race/Ethnicity and CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Scores\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Census Data\nAmerican Community Survey Data, ACS Handbooks for Data Users\nNational Water Quality Portal\nU.S. EPA EJ Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key to an equity analysis is to compare it to a baseline where race and ethnicity were not factors. Adding demographics data to your data project can help increase understanding of potential correlations or relationships between your data and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of locations of interest.\nDepending on what demographics data sources you decide to use, the methods needed to combine, overlay, or compare with the data you are interested in may vary. Below we outline methods of comparing demographics data to point, line, and polygon data types.\n\n\nIt’s important to remember that you can always benefit from setting context before trying to communicate demographic or specific racial equity answers to questions posed by our Board, a member of the public, or a partner in this work. What your program is about, what does it do, how well does it do these things (aka Performance Report), etc. This may take a few different visualizations to help frame the context of the program mission but will help viewers understand how you are approaching the racial equity data work within the scope of your program. \nOften the go-to resources for making inferences to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics is the National Census dataset and the associated American Community Survey dataset. While we are fortunate to have just updated this dataset in 2020 there are limitations and potential inaccuracies associated with relying solely on census data to enumerate demographic characteristics within a given census tract. This tool from the Department of Finance exists to measure this limitation.\nA detailed example of using R programming to estimate demographics and other characteristics with U.S. census data to be used for custom spatial features is available and can be tailored to programs with the help of a data scientist proficient in R and staff familiar with the program. https://daltare.github.io/example-census-race-ethnicity-calculation/example_census_race_ethnicity_calculation.html\nExample - SAFER Fund Expenditure Plan\nSection VIII.G. Racial Equity and Environmental Justice provides several tables with data that incorporates demographics data. The tables and the text lack clarity and indepth analysis on why the data is telling the story it is. Race and ethnicity of the populations served by the systems likely isn’t the only only difference between the systems. Are there other factors that are associated with different populations that could be driving the imbalance in failing systems and funding? Perhaps, the majority-Hispanic population systems are much larger, or older, or have more severe problems. An apples to apples comparison would look at the major factors that determine cost and compare the racial difference between those subgroups. For example, comparing the racial and ethnic differences between systems of medium sized cities with a water treatment plant built within the past 30 years. Making these proportions more explicit and adding a section where Hispanics population systems get more funding, proportionally and list some additional explanatory factors that should be explored.\nTIP: It’s ok to note data gaps, and in the case of racial equity data, gaps will be the norm. It is a key part of a good analysis to identify data gaps and set a course for filling those gaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California Water Boards Racial Equity Data Resource Hub provides a list of Water Boards Developed Racial Equity Data Tools\n\n\n\nCalEnviroScreen 4.0\nCalEnviroScreen can be a helpful tool in creating visualizations and performing analysis as it provides a number of indices, as well as a “rolled-up” score that combines environmental and demographic data together. However, there can be things to consider, a couple of which are discussed below.\n\n\n\nUsers conducting an analysis with the CalEnviroScreen (CES) 4.0 dataset should be aware that it contains missing values, both for individual indicators and overall CES scores. These missing values are distinct from zeros, which are also in the CES dataset. For more information about the missing (and zero) values, see the data dictionary (calenviroscreen40resultsdatadictionary_F_2021.pdf) that accompanies the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 results Excel workbook, available for download as a zip file here.\nIn the CES 4.0 data (for the version available as of April 2023), the shapefile containing CES 4.0 scores (available here) encodes these missing values as negative numbers (-999 for most variables, and -1998 for one variable). The Excel workbook containing CES 4.0 scores (available here) encodes these missing values as NA. Users should account for these missing values – and their different encodings – as needed when doing any analysis using CES data. Also, note that the CalEnviroScreen 3 shapefile (June 2018 update version) encoded missing values as 0, so users should be aware of this change if/when updating an analysis from CES 3 to CES 4.0 data.\n\n\n\nIn the CES 4.0 data (for the version available as of April 2023), the shapefile containing CES 4.0 scores (available here) uses a simplified version of the polygons that represent 2010 census tracts. The boundaries of the census tracts defined by these simplified polygons do not always align with the boundaries of neighboring census tracts, resulting in slight gaps or overlaps between some neighboring census tracts. These inconsistencies are not likely to have a significant impact on most uses of the CES data, but they could impact some types of analysis based on CES data. For example, when assessing sites or facilities based on the CES score of the census tract they are located in, sites located near a census tract boundary could be associated with more than one census tract (and more than one CES score) in areas where there are overlapping census tract polygons, or not associated with any census tract (and no CES score) in areas where there are gaps between census tract polygons. This issue may be addressed in a future release of the CES dataset; in the meantime, a possible workaround is to use the official 2010 census tract boundaries from the US Census Bureau for any calculations, then use census tract IDs to tie this information to the associated CES score for each tract.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be instances where the data you need are not already available and you need to collect it yourself through the use of survey(s).\n\n\nCreating surveys that yield actionable insights is all about the details - and writing effective survey questions is the first step. You do not have to be an expert to build and distribute an effective online survey, but by checking your survey against tried-and-tested benchmarks, you can help ensure you are collecting the best data possible.  \nTips for Building an Effective Survey:\n\nMake Sure That Every Question Is Necessary.\nKeep it Short and Simple.\nAsk Direct Questions.\nAsk One Question at a Time.\nAvoid Leading and Biased Questions.\nSpeak Your Respondent’s Language.\nUse Response Scales Whenever Possible.\nAvoid Using Grids or Matrices for Responses.\nRephrase Yes/No Questions if Possible\nTake Your Survey for a Test Drive\n\nA good comprehensive guide for survey design can be found here: \n\nCreating Effective Surveys - Best Practices\nHow to Create an Effective Survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Water Board staff will use Microsoft Forms which is available to all staff through the Microsoft 365 suite of applications.  Microsoft Forms has a lot of advantages because of its integration with other Microsoft tools like Excel and PowerBi which allow for the survey results to be analyzed and visualized.  Here is video on how to make that connection between Forms and PowerBi via Sharepoint that allows for consistent updating of results:  https://youtu.be/XBFVDedwLiY?si=O161oYja-FBhG1W7 \nOne issue with Microsoft Forms and other free software like Google Forms is that they produce wide data in Excel of Google Sheets.  This type of data is more difficult to transform.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "After a project is complete (or has gone through a complete iteration) - it’s important to assess the project and evaluate the extent to which it has achieved the goals you set for it and advanced and improved equity outcomes. There are several ways to achieve this. Below is a list of methods one might consider utilizing for this phase of the data life cycle.\nDepending on what you discover during the evaluation process, you may need to undergo a second phase or iteration of the project to integrate lessons and get closer to achieving the original goals and desired equity outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhile the processes below include numerical steps - that does not mean steps must be completed in that order, or that steps must be completed all at once. Moreover, teams don’t need to wait until the project is complete to benefit from using these tools! It may be helpful to use some or all of these tools during the Plan & Prepare phase, and then revisit and iterate some or all components at multiple points during your project or process.\nWhen in doubt - make time to use these tools early and often!\n\n\n\n\nRoot cause analysis is a technique that helps identify the fundamental reasons, or root causes, of a problem or unwanted outcome. Once the root causes are idenditifed, actions can be taken to address those causes and minimize or eliminate their impact on outcomes. Identifying the root cause(s) is the most effective way to prevent future problems and ultimately remedy existing ones.\n\n\nIt can be tempting to jump straight into the Root Cause Analysis process. Before you do, it’s important to think through the below considerations and prepare accordingly.\n\n\nRoot Cause Analysis should not be completed in a silo. At the very least, the team should include individuals within our organization that are interested in working on and correcting the problem at hand. At best, the team would include partners from communities that are impacted by the problem at hand. Inclusion of external partners enables us to give voice to important perspectives and the lived experiences of those who have been and/or are currently being impacted by the problem. When the team does not include such critical perspectives, there is a tendency to rush to propose solutions that address symptoms of the problem, rather than the actual root causes of the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectively Partnering with Communities Requires Commitment\n\n\n\nRemember that effectively partnering with communities requires making a commitment that extends beyond soliciting feedback in focus groups and surveys. A sustained, long-term, reciprocal relationship must be built on trust and open, honest communication where power is shared. Taking the time to strengthen those relationships will not only benefit the organization but also the outcomes of the communities served.\nQuote adapted from Advancing Health Equity’s Root Cause Analysis Page\n\n\nSee Step 3 of the Planning Phase for more guidance.\n\n\n\nIt takes time to truly and deeply interrogate the “whys” and data associated with the problem at hand. Depending on the complexity of the problem, the team should plan to meet over the course of a few weeks to a few months to complete the process.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve made it this far into your process, it probably means that you are truly interested and invested in operationalizng and advancing equity into your data-intensive work. Part of that process is acknowledging hard truths and sitting with discomfort. Team members may share perspectives, experiences, or identify root causes during the process that bring up uncomfortable or unfamiliar feelings. While experiencing those feelings is normal, it’s important to remember to honor hard truths, and prioritize the process over your comfort.\n\nIntegrity is choosing courage over comfort\nIt’s choosing what’s right over what’s fun, fast, or easy\nAnd it’s practicing your values, not just professing them\n— Brené Brown, Dare to Lead\n\nWhen it comes to the Root Cause Analysis process specifically, it’s important to be aware of and push back on views that reinforce individual responsibility over the role of systemic, structural, and institutional racism.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the problem\nBuilt a team that includes people who are impacted by the problem\nSchedule time over the course of a few weeks to a few months to complete the process. How you use this time is up to you. Using meetings to iterate on the brainstorming and feedback processes so you can:\n\nDig deep into the issue by working with team members to compile or analyze data to help you understand the issue\nidentify the true root causes of the issue\nIdentify potential actions to address the root causes\nPrioritize actions that the team can take to address the problem and improve equity outcomes.\n\nInterrogate the problem and associated data with an equity lens by asking “why” at least 5 times.\nPrioritize actions you/your team can take to address the root cause(s) of the problem. You will likely find root causes and potential actions that are outside of your control. Be sure to prioritize actions that you can actually address, and be realistic about the time and resources needed to fully address them.\n\nStep 4 above is the core of the process, and can be completed using many different methodologies or approaches. Below are a few simple graphical templates you can use to get started!\n\n\n\nGraphical templates illustrating approaches to the problem interrogation process. A. is a simple template to walk teams through the 5 whys and identify priority actions. B. is a more nuanced template with prompts for teams to think about potential causes of each “why” response. C. is a flow chart illustrating the complexity that can result in a thorough Root Cause Analysis process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults-Based Accountability (RBA)1 is a tool to support a disciplined way of thinking and taking action that can be used to improve the performance of programs or projects and their associated outcomes.\nThe RBA process involves two parts, each asking a set of seven questions, and starts with the desired results (outcomes, impact) and works backward towards the means (solutions, strategies, actions) to ensure that plans work toward community-centered results and implementation. The RBA process also helps to distinguish between population level (whole groups) indicators, that are the responsibility of multiple systems and take a long time to shift, and performance measures (activity-specific) that teams can use to determine whether what they do is having an impact.\n\n\n\n\nIn step 4 below, teams will use Root Cause Analysis to understand the “whys” behind the trends they see in the data related to their work. As such, it will be critical to remember the considerations in the Root Cause Analysis section and apply them to Step 4 (and all other steps) of the RBA Process as well: Put a team together, Allocate time to the process, Don’t avoid hard truths.\n\n\n\nTo truly achieve the impact we require with our racial equity goals, it is essential that the work be community based and participatory. The process requires taking time to develop relationship, trust, and true partnership with the communities that are most impacted by our work so that solutions to the problem at hand are co-created with and groundtruthed by those who will ultimately benefit or be burdened by the intended and unintended impacts of the decisions.\nFor more information, see the Put a team together consideration under the Root Cause Analysis section above, and the below Living Cities RBA Video on the importance of community participatory practice.\nIn the video, Theo Miller (Executive Director of Hope SF) notes that a truly rigorous, data-driven, and equity centered RBA process requires:\n\nintegrating community in the data process\nacknowledging of the power dynamics of data\ntransparency of data and results throughout the process (see the Publish and Share section for guidance on how to make data and products transparent, open, and accessible)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture is a set of living relationships working towards a shared goal. It’s not something you are, it’s something you do.\n— Daniel Coyle, The Culture Code\n\nOur organization’s culture lives at the intersection of our values and behavior. Our decisions reflect what we value (i.e., racial equity) and how we behave (i.e., our actions). Shifting our institutional cultures to be more data driven, equitable, inclusive, and kind takes time and can be uncomfortable.\nAs noted in the Beginners Guide to Anti-Racist RBA:\n\nAnti-racist RBA requires that you look inward and understand how your own power, privilege, biases, world view and identity impacts everything that you do, and then having done that personal work use your power, understanding of history, awareness of your blind spots, and ability to identify and interrupt instances of racism to make more equitable decisions in your role. These are the behaviors that lead to systems change.\n\nIn the below Living Cities RBA Video, Robin Brule (The Integration Initiative Director) details the journey and tensions she and her team at City Alive underwent and are continuously work through as they implement the RBA framework:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen embarking on the journey to operationalize equity into our organizations and our work, it can be overwhelming and difficult to know where to start. The first part of the RBA process provides a framework for determining what actions we can take first to begin to achieve our racial equity goals.\n\nWhat are the desired results? These statements should (1) reflect the equity outcomes you want to see in the whole population (i.e., communities, cities, states), and (2) positive conditions (e.g., “healthy” vs. “not sick”). If you’re stuck, try filling in the following statement: “We want communities that are [ insert positive condition that reflects an equity outcome ]”\nWhat would the results look like? These statements should be (1) culturally relevant, contextualized, and connected to the vision the team has with respect to equity outcomes you want to see in the whole population, and (2) specific to the community of interest, not just any community. If you’re stuck, think about what experiencing the outcome/result/condition of well being would look like for that community? What would it feel like? How would people be better off?\nWhat are the community indicators that would measure the desired results? These indicators should be population-level, large-scale measures. Because of the scope and scale of the indicators, population level data often comes from government or agencies (i.e., federal, state, city, or county; e.g. source Census data). These indicators will likely reflect generations of systemic inequities that cannot be changed quickly. However, the small number of indicators that are selected can be used to focus and concentrate the team’s efforts, and to hold the team’s efforts accountable to population-level systems change over time.\nWhat do the data tell us? This step requires two parts. First, look at the data trends for each indicator using whatever demographic breakdowns that are relevant to your work (e.g. aggregated and/or disaggregated by race/ethnicity; see the Consider how you group the data for guidance). Then, conduct a Root Cause Analysis to understand the “whys” behind the data trends. Conducting a thorough root cause analysis is critical to help move teams past superficial understandings of racial inequity (e.g. symptoms) and to the underlying (root) causes of inequity.\nWho are our partners? Who should the team work with to ensure we reach our equity goals and have an impact on the community? You may have identified some of your potential partners during the Planning phase; now is another good time to take another look at the list and ask yourself:\n\nWho is missing from our partner list? Have we considered groups that we haven’t worked with (or even have avoided) in the past that could give critical perspective and insight to maximize our impact?\nFor each partner on the list: Why are they important? What do we need them for? How do we think they can contribute to the process and help us advance outcomes? Note that your response to this last question might differ from how the group would respond for themselves.\n\nNote that engaging with each partner on your list is a completely different step that requires time to build relationships and trust. For some partners on the list, that engagement might happen concurrently as you are completing this process. For others, it might come later.\nWhat works to change the data trend towards racial equity? What specific actions can be taken to address root causes and ultimately decrease racial disparities. During this step, the group should brainstorm a large number of actions, ideally in a judgement free zone. If you’re stuck, try thinking of ideas that fall under the following categories: Low-cost / no-cost ideas; ideas from community, traditional or indigenous knowledge; promising practices; evidence-based practices; creative out-of-the-box or “imagine if” ideas. More is more in this step get all ideas out there without worrying about costs, practicality, implementation, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganize your thoughts post-brainstorm!\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve completed the generative brainstorming process, you will likely (hopefully!) have a large number of ideas. Take some time to review ideas and group like ideas together. This will help identify similar ideas stated in different ways and will make it easier gather your thoughts when you begin the prioritization process in the next step.\n\n\nWhat actions should we start with? For each action (or group of similar action ideas), answer the questions associated with each criteria category to help determine which actions will be prioritized during implementation:\n\nValues: Is the action strengths-based, people-centered, culturally relevant, and anti-racist? Does it advance our racial equity goals?\nLeverage: How likely is the action to change the trendline towards equity? What additional resources for change does it activate?\nReach: Is the action feasible given our current resources? Will completing this action actually benefit communities experiencing inequities?\nSpecificity: Does the action have a timeline with deliverables that answer the questions who, what, when, where, and how?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeasibility does not equal business as usual\n\n\n\nNote that we might need to adjust and reprioritize our workloads (i.e., how we spend our time) and resources (i.e., how we spend our money) to make an action truly feasible. If this is necessary but it also makes completing the action feasible, it should be considered a feasible action!\nThis process and way of thinking disrupts historical patterns of “doing (or not doing) what we’ve always done because we’ve always done it that way.” That way of work, regardless of our good intentions, does not produce the racial equity we demand in our communities - and ultimately perpetuates inequitable outcomes.\nIf we are truly interested and invested in advancing and operationalizing equity into our work, we need to seriously consider making different choices. This is an opportunity to walk the talk of equity - to put our time, money, and resources where our proverbial mouths are - to go from preformative words about the importance of equity to making the difficult decisions and taking the time and resources needed to actually practice and operationalize equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this phase of the RBA process, teams will develop performance measures to ensure the implementation of each action will:\n\nwork to decrease racial disparities\nhelp hold teams accountable to their commitments\ngive teams an understanding of how well implementation went and whether anyone is better off\n\nFor each of the priority actions identified in Part 1, teams will need to answer the following questions:\n\nWho do you serve? Identifying who you serve (whether an institution, people, a group, or a system) helps you gain clarity about the intended impact of your work and not attempt to make people accountable for change outside their scope of work.\nWhat is the action’s intended impact? Answering this question will generate the action’s performance measures and will mean the difference between doing business as usual, which has produced racially inequitable results for generations, and being accountable for the impact of our work.\nFirst, teams will answer the following questions to understand the intended impact of the action. Review how teams responded to “What would the results look like?” during Part 1 of the RBA process and refine the vision captured in those responses to make them specific to the action.\n\nWhat is the intended impact?\nHow would we know if the action worked?\nHow would we know if anyone is better off as a result of this action?\n\nThen, while keeping the broader intentions of the action in mind, teams will answer the following questions to develop performance measures that can be used to quantify the impact of the action.\n\nHow much did you do? (Quantity; e.g., number of clients and/or activities)\nHow well did you do it? (Quality; e.g., percentage of activity that was of high quality, percentage of common measures of appropriate/high quality)\nIs anyone better off? (Impact; e.g., number or percentage change in skills/knowledge, attitude/opinion, behavior, or circumstance)\n\nWhat is the quality of the action? The purpose of this group of metrics it to ensure the action is being done well. Consider metrics that can measure cultural relevance, language access, and participation rates to more technical measures of staff training and staff-to-client ratios. If the “better off” measures show no change, quality measures sometimes tell us why we are not having an impact. Alternately, just because the action is being implemented in a high-quality manner, does not mean that the “better off” data will move in the right direction.\nWhat is the story behind the data? It is critical to review the data at the performance level, ask why, and get to root causes - many might be the same as the community level, but it’s critical to take time to regularly review, confirm and adjust as needed. Review how teams responded to “What do the data tell us?” during Part 1 of the RBA process to refresh on root causes at the population level, and then refine understanding (as needed) to make them applicable and specific to the action. Completing this step makes the difference between perpetuating systemic failures to address racially disproportionate outcomes and disrupting them to operationalize equity and justice.\nWho are the partners with a role to play? Identify which partners would be the most effective and impactful to support completing this action. Review how teams responded to “Who are our partners?” during Part 1 of the RBA process and consider who is needed and in what role to move the work of this specific action forward. When teams fail to think about the partners that would make their work more effective, it results in the continuation of business as usual, and prevents them from having the thought partners at the table that would allow them to take their work from good to transformative.\nWhat works to have greater impact? As teams implement the action, take time periodically to reflect, especially when things are not going well, as planned, or the data coming in does not show the expected impact. Remember that you have already identified root cases at the population level (Part 1, What do the data tell us?) and the performance level (Part 2, What is the story behind the data?), and know that it takes time to see transformative and cultural change. If sufficient time has passed, consider how to use lessons learned, agency, partner, and community experience, and data to inform how to adapt the action to have a greater impact.\nWhat are the next steps? A commitment to action, just like in the population level process, is critical. This is where we turn our words into actions. Teams answer the questions below with as much precision and specificity as possible.\n\nWho will do what, by when?\nWhat resources are needed to get it done?\nIs this a long-term action that needs time or can it be done tomorrow?\nWhat is the active role of community leadership in making these decisions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument commitments to support collective accountability\n\n\n\nWhite answers to the above questions down and get confirmation from all parties to ensure everyone is on the same page with respect to agreed upon commitments.\nData will be required to evaluate the performance measures the team developed. Integrate those performance measures, data needs, commitments, and timelnes into the Data & Product Evaluation section of the project’s Data Management Plan!\n\n\n\nBelow is a graphical illustration of the main RBA Part 2 process components.\n\n\n\nGraphical illustration of the components of Part 2 of the RBA Process teams will go through to develop performance measures for each priority action, which will enable collective accountability throughout the implementation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe questions below can helps us integrate an explicit focus on racial equity as we develop, review, and revise our projects. Some of the questions below are similar to the questions posed in the Root Cause Analysis and RBA sections, as well as in the Planning Phase. The main difference is that Root Cause Analysis, RBA, and planning phases can involve formal longer-term processes whereas the questions below are more flexible and can be applied as needed during any phase of a project.\n\nWhat’s the policy, program, practice, or budget decision under consideration? What are the desired results and outcomes?\nWhat’s the data and what does it tell us?\nHow have communities been engaged?

    "text": "Root cause analysis is a technique that helps identify the fundamental reasons, or root causes, of a problem or unwanted outcome. Once the root causes are idenditifed, actions can be taken to address those causes and minimize or eliminate their impact on outcomes. Identifying the root cause(s) is the most effective way to prevent future problems and ultimately remedy existing ones.\n\n\nIt can be tempting to jump straight into the Root Cause Analysis process. Before you do, it’s important to think through the below considerations and prepare accordingly.\n\n\nRoot Cause Analysis should not be completed in a silo. At the very least, the team should include individuals within our organization that are interested in working on and correcting the problem at hand. At best, the team would include partners from communities that are impacted by the problem at hand. Inclusion of external partners enables us to give voice to important perspectives and the lived experiences of those who have been and/or are currently being impacted by the problem. When the team does not include such critical perspectives, there is a tendency to rush to propose solutions that address symptoms of the problem, rather than the actual root causes of the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectively Partnering with Communities Requires Commitment\n\n\n\nRemember that effectively partnering with communities requires making a commitment that extends beyond soliciting feedback in focus groups and surveys. A sustained, long-term, reciprocal relationship must be built on trust and open, honest communication where power is shared. Taking the time to strengthen those relationships will not only benefit the organization but also the outcomes of the communities served.\nQuote adapted from Advancing Health Equity’s Root Cause Analysis Page\n\n\nSee Step 3 of the Planning Phase for more guidance.\n\n\n\nIt takes time to truly and deeply interrogate the “whys” and data associated with the problem at hand. Depending on the complexity of the problem, the team should plan to meet over the course of a few weeks to a few months to complete the process.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve made it this far into your process, it probably means that you are truly interested and invested in operationalizng and advancing equity into your data-intensive work. Part of that process is acknowledging hard truths and sitting with discomfort. Team members may share perspectives, experiences, or identify root causes during the process that bring up uncomfortable or unfamiliar feelings. While experiencing those feelings is normal, it’s important to remember to honor hard truths, and prioritize the process over your comfort.\n\nIntegrity is choosing courage over comfort\nIt’s choosing what’s right over what’s fun, fast, or easy\nAnd it’s practicing your values, not just professing them\n— Brené Brown, Dare to Lead\n\nWhen it comes to the Root Cause Analysis process specifically, it’s important to be aware of and push back on views that reinforce individual responsibility over the role of systemic, structural, and institutional racism.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the problem\nBuilt a team that includes people who are impacted by the problem\nSchedule time over the course of a few weeks to a few months to complete the process. How you use this time is up to you. Using meetings to iterate on the brainstorming and feedback processes so you can:\n\nDig deep into the issue by working with team members to compile or analyze data to help you understand the issue\nidentify the true root causes of the issue\nIdentify potential actions to address the root causes\nPrioritize actions that the team can take to address the problem and improve equity outcomes.\n\nInterrogate the problem and associated data with an equity lens by asking “why” at least 5 times.\nPrioritize actions you/your team can take to address the root cause(s) of the problem. You will likely find root causes and potential actions that are outside of your control. Be sure to prioritize actions that you can actually address, and be realistic about the time and resources needed to fully address them.\n\nStep 4 above is the core of the process, and can be completed using many different methodologies or approaches. Below are a few simple graphical templates you can use to get started!\n\n\n\nGraphical templates illustrating approaches to the problem interrogation process. A. is a simple template to walk teams through the 5 whys and identify priority actions. B. is a more nuanced template with prompts for teams to think about potential causes of each “why” response. C. is a flow chart illustrating the complexity that can result in a thorough Root Cause Analysis process.",

    "text": "Results-Based Accountability (RBA)1 is a tool to support a disciplined way of thinking and taking action that can be used to improve the performance of programs or projects and their associated outcomes.\nThe RBA process involves two parts, each asking a set of seven questions, and starts with the desired results (outcomes, impact) and works backward towards the means (solutions, strategies, actions) to ensure that plans work toward community-centered results and implementation. The RBA process also helps to distinguish between population level (whole groups) indicators, that are the responsibility of multiple systems and take a long time to shift, and performance measures (activity-specific) that teams can use to determine whether what they do is having an impact.\n\n\n\n\nIn step 4 below, teams will use Root Cause Analysis to understand the “whys” behind the trends they see in the data related to their work. As such, it will be critical to remember the considerations in the Root Cause Analysis section and apply them to Step 4 (and all other steps) of the RBA Process as well: Put a team together, Allocate time to the process, Don’t avoid hard truths.\n\n\n\nTo truly achieve the impact we require with our racial equity goals, it is essential that the work be community based and participatory. The process requires taking time to develop relationship, trust, and true partnership with the communities that are most impacted by our work so that solutions to the problem at hand are co-created with and groundtruthed by those who will ultimately benefit or be burdened by the intended and unintended impacts of the decisions.\nFor more information, see the Put a team together consideration under the Root Cause Analysis section above, and the below Living Cities RBA Video on the importance of community participatory practice.\nIn the video, Theo Miller (Executive Director of Hope SF) notes that a truly rigorous, data-driven, and equity centered RBA process requires:\n\nintegrating community in the data process\nacknowledging of the power dynamics of data\ntransparency of data and results throughout the process (see the Publish and Share section for guidance on how to make data and products transparent, open, and accessible)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture is a set of living relationships working towards a shared goal. It’s not something you are, it’s something you do.\n— Daniel Coyle, The Culture Code\n\nOur organization’s culture lives at the intersection of our values and behavior. Our decisions reflect what we value (i.e., racial equity) and how we behave (i.e., our actions). Shifting our institutional cultures to be more data driven, equitable, inclusive, and kind takes time and can be uncomfortable.\nAs noted in the Beginners Guide to Anti-Racist RBA:\n\nAnti-racist RBA requires that you look inward and understand how your own power, privilege, biases, world view and identity impacts everything that you do, and then having done that personal work use your power, understanding of history, awareness of your blind spots, and ability to identify and interrupt instances of racism to make more equitable decisions in your role. These are the behaviors that lead to systems change.\n\nIn the below Living Cities RBA Video, Robin Brule (The Integration Initiative Director) details the journey and tensions she and her team at City Alive underwent and are continuously work through as they implement the RBA framework:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen embarking on the journey to operationalize equity into our organizations and our work, it can be overwhelming and difficult to know where to start. The first part of the RBA process provides a framework for determining what actions we can take first to begin to achieve our racial equity goals.\n\nWhat are the desired results? These statements should (1) reflect the equity outcomes you want to see in the whole population (i.e., communities, cities, states), and (2) positive conditions (e.g., “healthy” vs. “not sick”). If you’re stuck, try filling in the following statement: “We want communities that are [ insert positive condition that reflects an equity outcome ]”\nWhat would the results look like? These statements should be (1) culturally relevant, contextualized, and connected to the vision the team has with respect to equity outcomes you want to see in the whole population, and (2) specific to the community of interest, not just any community. If you’re stuck, think about what experiencing the outcome/result/condition of well being would look like for that community? What would it feel like? How would people be better off?\nWhat are the community indicators that would measure the desired results? These indicators should be population-level, large-scale measures. Because of the scope and scale of the indicators, population level data often comes from government or agencies (i.e., federal, state, city, or county; e.g. source Census data). These indicators will likely reflect generations of systemic inequities that cannot be changed quickly. However, the small number of indicators that are selected can be used to focus and concentrate the team’s efforts, and to hold the team’s efforts accountable to population-level systems change over time.\nWhat do the data tell us? This step requires two parts. First, look at the data trends for each indicator using whatever demographic breakdowns that are relevant to your work (e.g. aggregated and/or disaggregated by race/ethnicity; see the Consider how you group the data for guidance). Then, conduct a Root Cause Analysis to understand the “whys” behind the data trends. Conducting a thorough root cause analysis is critical to help move teams past superficial understandings of racial inequity (e.g. symptoms) and to the underlying (root) causes of inequity.\nWho are our partners? Who should the team work with to ensure we reach our equity goals and have an impact on the community? You may have identified some of your potential partners during the Planning phase; now is another good time to take another look at the list and ask yourself:\n\nWho is missing from our partner list? Have we considered groups that we haven’t worked with (or even have avoided) in the past that could give critical perspective and insight to maximize our impact?\nFor each partner on the list: Why are they important? What do we need them for? How do we think they can contribute to the process and help us advance outcomes? Note that your response to this last question might differ from how the group would respond for themselves.\n\nNote that engaging with each partner on your list is a completely different step that requires time to build relationships and trust. For some partners on the list, that engagement might happen concurrently as you are completing this process. For others, it might come later.\nWhat works to change the data trend towards racial equity? What specific actions can be taken to address root causes and ultimately decrease racial disparities. During this step, the group should brainstorm a large number of actions, ideally in a judgement free zone. If you’re stuck, try thinking of ideas that fall under the following categories: Low-cost / no-cost ideas; ideas from community, traditional or indigenous knowledge; promising practices; evidence-based practices; creative out-of-the-box or “imagine if” ideas. More is more in this step get all ideas out there without worrying about costs, practicality, implementation, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganize your thoughts post-brainstorm!\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve completed the generative brainstorming process, you will likely (hopefully!) have a large number of ideas. Take some time to review ideas and group like ideas together. This will help identify similar ideas stated in different ways and will make it easier gather your thoughts when you begin the prioritization process in the next step.\n\n\nWhat actions should we start with? For each action (or group of similar action ideas), answer the questions associated with each criteria category to help determine which actions will be prioritized during implementation:\n\nValues: Is the action strengths-based, people-centered, culturally relevant, and anti-racist? Does it advance our racial equity goals?\nLeverage: How likely is the action to change the trendline towards equity? What additional resources for change does it activate?\nReach: Is the action feasible given our current resources? Will completing this action actually benefit communities experiencing inequities?\nSpecificity: Does the action have a timeline with deliverables that answer the questions who, what, when, where, and how?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeasibility does not equal business as usual\n\n\n\nNote that we might need to adjust and reprioritize our workloads (i.e., how we spend our time) and resources (i.e., how we spend our money) to make an action truly feasible. If this is necessary but it also makes completing the action feasible, it should be considered a feasible action!\nThis process and way of thinking disrupts historical patterns of “doing (or not doing) what we’ve always done because we’ve always done it that way.” That way of work, regardless of our good intentions, does not produce the racial equity we demand in our communities - and ultimately perpetuates inequitable outcomes.\nIf we are truly interested and invested in advancing and operationalizing equity into our work, we need to seriously consider making different choices. This is an opportunity to walk the talk of equity - to put our time, money, and resources where our proverbial mouths are - to go from preformative words about the importance of equity to making the difficult decisions and taking the time and resources needed to actually practice and operationalize equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this phase of the RBA process, teams will develop performance measures to ensure the implementation of each action will:\n\nwork to decrease racial disparities\nhelp hold teams accountable to their commitments\ngive teams an understanding of how well implementation went and whether anyone is better off\n\nFor each of the priority actions identified in Part 1, teams will need to answer the following questions:\n\nWho do you serve? Identifying who you serve (whether an institution, people, a group, or a system) helps you gain clarity about the intended impact of your work and not attempt to make people accountable for change outside their scope of work.\nWhat is the action’s intended impact? Answering this question will generate the action’s performance measures and will mean the difference between doing business as usual, which has produced racially inequitable results for generations, and being accountable for the impact of our work.\nFirst, teams will answer the following questions to understand the intended impact of the action. Review how teams responded to “What would the results look like?” during Part 1 of the RBA process and refine the vision captured in those responses to make them specific to the action.\n\nWhat is the intended impact?\nHow would we know if the action worked?\nHow would we know if anyone is better off as a result of this action?\n\nThen, while keeping the broader intentions of the action in mind, teams will answer the following questions to develop performance measures that can be used to quantify the impact of the action.\n\nHow much did you do? (Quantity; e.g., number of clients and/or activities)\nHow well did you do it? (Quality; e.g., percentage of activity that was of high quality, percentage of common measures of appropriate/high quality)\nIs anyone better off? (Impact; e.g., number or percentage change in skills/knowledge, attitude/opinion, behavior, or circumstance)\n\nWhat is the quality of the action? The purpose of this group of metrics it to ensure the action is being done well. Consider metrics that can measure cultural relevance, language access, and participation rates to more technical measures of staff training and staff-to-client ratios. If the “better off” measures show no change, quality measures sometimes tell us why we are not having an impact. Alternately, just because the action is being implemented in a high-quality manner, does not mean that the “better off” data will move in the right direction.\nWhat is the story behind the data? It is critical to review the data at the performance level, ask why, and get to root causes - many might be the same as the community level, but it’s critical to take time to regularly review, confirm and adjust as needed. Review how teams responded to “What do the data tell us?” during Part 1 of the RBA process to refresh on root causes at the population level, and then refine understanding (as needed) to make them applicable and specific to the action. Completing this step makes the difference between perpetuating systemic failures to address racially disproportionate outcomes and disrupting them to operationalize equity and justice.\nWho are the partners with a role to play? Identify which partners would be the most effective and impactful to support completing this action. Review how teams responded to “Who are our partners?” during Part 1 of the RBA process and consider who is needed and in what role to move the work of this specific action forward. When teams fail to think about the partners that would make their work more effective, it results in the continuation of business as usual, and prevents them from having the thought partners at the table that would allow them to take their work from good to transformative.\nWhat works to have greater impact? As teams implement the action, take time periodically to reflect, especially when things are not going well, as planned, or the data coming in does not show the expected impact. Remember that you have already identified root cases at the population level (Part 1, What do the data tell us?) and the performance level (Part 2, What is the story behind the data?), and know that it takes time to see transformative and cultural change. If sufficient time has passed, consider how to use lessons learned, agency, partner, and community experience, and data to inform how to adapt the action to have a greater impact.\nWhat are the next steps? A commitment to action, just like in the population level process, is critical. This is where we turn our words into actions. Teams answer the questions below with as much precision and specificity as possible.\n\nWho will do what, by when?\nWhat resources are needed to get it done?\nIs this a long-term action that needs time or can it be done tomorrow?\nWhat is the active role of community leadership in making these decisions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument commitments to support collective accountability\n\n\n\nWhite answers to the above questions down and get confirmation from all parties to ensure everyone is on the same page with respect to agreed upon commitments.\nData will be required to evaluate the performance measures the team developed. Integrate those performance measures, data needs, commitments, and timelnes into the Data & Product Evaluation section of the project’s Data Management Plan!\n\n\n\nBelow is a graphical illustration of the main RBA Part 2 process components.\n\n\n\nGraphical illustration of the components of Part 2 of the RBA Process teams will go through to develop performance measures for each priority action, which will enable collective accountability throughout the implementation process.",

    "text": "During its August 18, 2020 meeting, the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) publicly acknowledged that the historical effects of institutional racism must be confronted throughout government, and it directed staff to develop a priority plan of action (Aug 18, 2020 Meeting Agenda, Recording). The State Water Board’s Racial Equity Team held public and employee listening sessions to help develop a draft resolution. After a public comment period on the draft resolution in spring 2021, the Racial Equity Team made significant updates to the resolution. On November 16, 2021, the State Water Board adopted Resolution No. 2021-0050, “Condemning Racism, Xenophobia, Bigotry, and Racial Injustice and Strengthening Commitment to Racial Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Access, and Anti-Racism” (Racial Equity Resolution; English, Español) which affirms the State Water Board’s commitment to racial equity and directs staff to undertake a variety of actions to achieve racial equity throughout all State Water Board programs and activities (Nov 16, 2021 Meeting Agenda, Recording).\nThe Racial Equity Resolution is one milestone on our ongoing journey to operationalize equity throughout our organization. The next step is to implement the Racial Equity Action Plan (2023-2025; English, Español), which includes specific actions the State Water Board will take to address racial inequities, as well as metrics to measure our progress. With this Action Plan, we envision a sustainable California where race no longer predicts where clean water is available or who has access to it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity is an outcome\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that racial equity and equity in general is an outcome and there is no such thing as a “racial equity data-set” or “racial equity data”.\nInstead we should think of data as a tool to help us achieve the overall outcome of equity - and how we view, use, and act on data and related tools is what will determine whether we operationalize equity or perpetuate injustice.\n\n\nDevelopment of the Racial Equity Action Plan began in Spring 2022 and involved public and employee engagement and tribal consultations. The Water Boards’ Racial Equity Team presented the Racial Equity Action Plan (2023-2025) to the State Water Board as an informational item at the Board Meeting on January 18, 2023 (Agenda, Slides, Recording).\nGoal 1a of the Racial Equity Action Plan is to ensure Water Boards data are accessible, equitable, and culturally relevant. One action captured under that goal is the development of a Racial Equity Data Action Plan which must: \n\nDevelop training and best practices guidance for Water Boards staff on incorporating racial equity concepts into the planning and design of data collection methods and visualizations (e.g., maps, factsheets, etc.) projects.\nIdentify and expand existing opportunities for public participation in science and community data gathering programs to develop new data collection methods, support existing programs, and incorporate community datasets into the database. \nCreate a publicly accessible data catalog tool / interface that includes existing demographic data, Water Boards program data, and other available data (such as heat maps or flood hazard maps) to inform the implementation of the Racial Equity Action Plan.\n\nThe Racial Equity Data Action Plan is being developed by the Water Board’s Racial Equity Data Subcommittee of the Environmental Justice Roundtable which is a group of volunteer staff from across the Water Board led by the Office of Information Management and Analysis and the Office of Public Participation. This Handbook is intended to address Item 1 above by providing staff a best practices guide for incorporating racial equity concepts into the Water Board programs using data and information. Item 2 above will be iterative and grow as staff and programs begin to utilize the guidance and tools found within this handbook. To fulfill Item 3 above staff have created a California Water Boards Racial Equity Data Resource Hub which will grow as more programs create and publish racial equity based tools and visualizations.\n\n\n\nRacial Equity at the Water Boards\nRacial Equity Resolution Annotated References (2021)",

    "text": "By now, you’ve completed all of your planning and prep and are ready to get to the analysis part of the project. Congratulations!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole point of data analysis is to turn data into information, knowledge, and wisdom that we can use to make decisions and take action.\n\n\n\nIdeally, the data-informed decisions we make and the corresponding actions we take will help us advance and operationalize equity. Using data to inform decisions can be challenging, and is even more so when applying an equity lens to our data work.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustrations of two perspectives on Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) In practice. Graphic adapted from Flood et al. (2016) and DataCamp (2023).\n\n\nAs the graphic above illustrates, the transition and transformation from data to wisdom requires adding context, meaning, and insight to the original data, while gaining experience and understanding as we progress. In the above graphic we define data, information, knowledge, and wisdom as:\n\nData: individual measurements, facts, figures, and signals, without context.\nInformation: organized, structured, and contextualized data that can be used to identify concepts of “who”, “what”, “where”, and “when”.\nKnowledge: the result of analyzing, synthesizing, and interpreting information to identify patterns, trends, and relationships, which can be used to understand the “how” and “why” of what we’re observing.\nWisdom: the ability to integrate what we understand from the data with other context, reflection, and underlying knowledge of the broader question or topic at hand with the express purpose of making data and equity-informed decisions and to take effective and impactful action.\n\n\n\nIncorporating a racial equity lens during data analysis includes incorporating individual, community, political, and historical contexts of race to inform analysis, conclusions, and recommendations. Solely relying on statistical outputs will not necessarily lead to meaningful insights without careful consideration during the analytical process, such as ensuring data quality is sufficient and determining appropriate statistical power.\nTurning data into information in the context of racial equity involves navigating complex ethical considerations. The process requires an understanding of the potential impact on Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) communities and the responsibility to mitigate perpetuating or reinforcing biases. Upholding ethical standards requires a commitment to maintaining privacy, accessibility, and fostering transparency throughout the data transformation process. Additionally, acknowledging the limitations of the data and being transparent about potential biases is essential for maintaining the integrity of the data and information generated and shared. The transformation of racial equity data into meaningful information requires a thoughtful and intentional approach which we will highlight in the next sections.\nFor example, many programs will rely on demographic and socioeconomic data, like those collected from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). Because the ACS is based on a sample, rather than all housing units and people, ACS estimates have a degree of uncertainty associated with them, called sampling error. In general, the larger the sample, the smaller the level of sampling error. To help users understand the impact of sampling error on data reliability, the Census Bureau provides a “margin of error” for each published ACS estimate. The margin of error, combined with the ACS estimate, gives users a range of values within which the actual “real-world” value is likely to fall. Also see: Using American Community Survey (ACS) Data: What All Data Users Need to Know Handbook.\nIt is important to acknowledge this uncertainty up front to be transparent with your audience about the data and conclusions you are drawing.\nExamples of how others have done this work include:\n\nCalif. Dept. of Finance Demographic Research Unit’s California Hard-to-Count Index Interactive Map, which measures the potential inaccuracies associated with relying on census data to enumerate demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in California\nOffice of Environmental Health and Hazard Assessment CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Race and Equity Analysis\n\n\n\nThere are five main data analysis method types, and each has a different process, purpose, and interpretation (see table below). As you embark on your analysis, it’s important to:\n\nunderstand which method(s) you can use given your data\nunderstand the limitations of your data and those method(s)\nselect the method(s) that are most appropriate for your project questions/objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Method\nPurpose\nLimitation\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Analytics\nSummarize and describe data in clear and simple way\nDescriptive analyses cannot tell us anything about why we’re seeing the results, patterns, or trends that are identified.\n\n\nInferential Analytics\nMake (infer) conclusions or generalizations about populations based on sample data\nConclusions can only be made on samples / data that are analysed, and the appropriate use and interpretation of the statistical method used depends on whether the data meets the assumptions of the method. If method assumptions are not met - results and conclusions are meaningless.\n\n\nDiagnostic Analytics\nTell us something about the “why” behind the results, patterns, or trends that are identified\nDepending on the data you have and the analysis you are able to use, your results may not be able to identify the root cause in the context of the lived experiences of the communities the data you’re using are meant to represent.\n\n\nPredictive Analytics\nHelp identify what might be likely to happen in the future given the previous trends or patterns found in the data\nYour ability to predict what may happen is highly dependent on (and limited by) the quantity, quality, and representativeness of the data that you use. If there are gaps in that data you feed your analytical methods, there will be similar gaps in your results.\n\n\nPrescriptive Analytics\nRecommend actions or decisions.\nThe potential analytical methods are complex and require a large amount of quality and relevant data and computing power to be implemented appropriately. One should also consider the implications of the potential actions and decisions being considered using an equity lens. Striking the balance between data-driven insights and equity considerations is essential for advancing equity outcomes.\n\n\nCausal Analytics\nUnderstand the cause and effect relationships between variables of interest.\nAll causal analytical tools require strong assumptions and can never fully capture all of the context of the relationships in questions (i.e. extraneous variables that cannot be measured or assessed). If these methods are used, be sure to ground-truth the results with the communities the data you’re using are meant to represent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with any analysis, we need to understand the limits of our data and the methods we use so we interpret the results we find appropriately. Below is an overview of common data fallacies to be aware of and avoid as you’re interpreting your results and making conclusions1:\n\n\n\nData Fallacy\nDescription\nAdditional Equity Considerations\n\n\n\n\nCherry Picking\n\nSelecting results that fit your hypothesis or claim, and excluding those that don’t.\nThis doesn’t mean you should always keep all data you have access to (see Data Processing).\nIt’s important to be aware of data or results you are excluding and to be honest and transparent about why you’re excluding it.\n\n\nCobra Effect\n(aka Perverse Incentive)\n\nSetting an incentive that accidentally produces the opposite result to the one intended.\nThis is all about unintended consequences of our decisions and actions.\nWhen you’re developing your project objectives, be sure to take the Planning step seriously and take the time needed to answer as many of the questions provided as possible.\n\n\nDanger of Summary Metrics\n\nOnly looking at summary metrics and missing big differences in the raw data.\nSummary metrics or descriptive analytics can (and should!) be used to help us understand out data. However it’s important to remember that they cannot tell us anything about why we’re seeing the results, patterns, or trends that are identified. Be sure to use summary metrics in concert with context and other analyses so you can see your data holistically.\n\n\nData Dredging\n\nRepeatedly testing new hypotheses against the same set of data, failing to acknowledge that most correlations will be the result of chance.\nIt can be exciting to uncover meaningful and logical correlations when conducting your analyses.\nSimilar to cherry picking, it’s important to be aware of your analytical methods (and their limitations), and to be honest and transparent about your project objectives before you begin your analysis (see Plan and Prepare) as well as why you’re accepting or rejecting the results you get after analyses are conducted appropriately.\n\n\nFalse Causality\n\nFalsely assuming when two events appear related that one must have caused the other.\nThe classic: correlation does not imply causation. Adding context for which you don’t have data can help here. Discussing preliminary trends/results with partners and communities can help you ground truth the numerical results you’re seeing with the lived experiences of those that may be impacted by your project. See the Planning section on collecting expert input for more guidance on outreach and engagement.\n\n\nGambler’s Fallacy\n(aka Monte Carlo Fallacy)\n\nMistakenly believing that because something has happened more frequently than usual, it’s now less likely to happen in future (and vice versa).\nTo combat this fallacy it will be important to understand the context and “why” behind the results you are seeing. There are a number methods designed to help identify the the “why” (and there may be more than one reason!).\nSee the Evaluation section for guidance and remember that you don’t need to wait until the project is complete to benefit from using these evaluation tools! In fact, it may be helpful to use these tools at multiple points during your project or process.\n\n\nGerrymandering\n\nManipulating the geographical boundaries used to group data in order to change the result.\nThis is closely related to how you use geographical boundaries to aggregate or group your data. During your Plan and Prepare phase, think through what geographic units are most appropriate for your project needs. Know that the data you have access to might be in one geographic unit (e.g. census tract, hydrologic unit code (HUC)) but your questions are related to a different unit (e.g. county, region, statewide) - so you may need to do some analyses to standardize units. Doing so has its benefits and limitations. No matter what analytical decision you make, it’s important to clearly document the reasoning behind your decision.\n\n\nHawthorne Effect\n(aka Observer Effect)\n\nThe act of monitoring someone can affect their behavior, leading to spurious findings.\nThis may not be directly relevant in the usual data work you do. However, it is particularly important when delivering surveys. Keep that in mind as you design, deliver, and analyze survey results.\n\n\nMcNamara Fallacy\n\nRelying solely on metrics in complex situations and losing sight of the bigger picture.\nIt can be easy for some of us to get lost in the weeds of data analysis. What’s key here is to take a step back from time to time and continue to connect our analyses or product development back to the broader and contextualized project and equity goals you set for the project during your Plan and Prepare phase.\nWorking with and/or discussing your analytical process and/or preliminary trends/results with partners and communities can also help you ground truth the numerical results you’re seeing with the lived experiences of those that may be impacted by your project, and pull you out of the data weeds and back into context-informed data work.\n\n\nOverfitting\n\nCreating a model that’s overly tailored to the data you have and not representative of the general trend.\nUsing data to describe the environment and inform our decisions is complex, and is even more so when applying an equity lens to our data work. What’s important here is to keep this in mind as you develop, test, and interpret models for your analyses.\n\n\nPublication Bias\n\nInteresting research findings are more likely to be published, distorting our impression of reality.\nIt’s important to remember that academic systems - like our government systems and including publishing institutions - have racist origins and biases that have excluded the science, research, and ways of knowing that have come from of Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) communities. This is why taking the time to develop relationships and partnerships with the communities our decisions and actions may impact is crucial.\nIncluding partners with the expertise that can only come from lived experiences in our projects from the beginnig, and giving that expertise the same weight as academic or research expertise can broaden our perspectives and help prevent publication (and other biases) from negatively impacting our project, process and advancement of equity.\nSee the Planning section on collecting expert input for more guidance.\n\n\nRegression Towards the Mean\n\nWhen something happens that’s unusually good or bad, it will revert back towards the average over time.\nA key component of this fallacy is that random chance influences the outcome. When looking at our data through an equity lens, we need to remember that racism and injustice are central to our collective history and can be traced back to before the founding of our country. We live and work in institutions and systems that have inherited those unjust decisions and processes. We know that, as government representatives, if we’re not clear and intentional about advancing racial equity in the work we do, it won’t happen and we will continue to perpetuate racial inequity. In other words, because of the unjust systems in which we work, we cannot depend on this fallacy and wait for the unusually “bad” or unjust results/trends to correct themselves or revert back to more equitable trends. Because government agencies created and perpetuated environmental racism, it is our responsibility to proactively advance racial equity and justice in all the work we do.\nIf our collective history and its deep connection to racism and injustice are not familiar to you - we recommend taking the Advancing Racial Equity training series offered by the Water Boards Training Academy and reviewing the GARE Framework: Normalize, Organize, and Operationalize. More details on both of these actions and others can be found on the Getting Started page. |\n\n\nSampling Bias\n\nDrawing conclusions from a set of data that isn’t representative of the population you’re trying to understand.\nDuring your Plan and Prepare you will think through the type of data that’s needed to adequitely represent the populations related to your project objectives. If the data available is not adequately representative, then you may need to revise the types of questions you have of the data (and analytical methods). Or, it might be worth considering collecting the data yourself or with partners.\nNote that this principle and others can also be applied to surveys. Keep that in mind as you design, deliver, and analyze survey results.\n\n\nSimpson’s Paradox\n\nWhen a trend appears in different subsets of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.\nThis is critical when trying to understand and quantify how environmental outcomes might impact different groups. During your Plan and Prepare phase, think through the different ways you might aggregate or disaggregate your data and consider what is appropriate for the questions you have.\nWithout disaggregating data by subgroup, analysis can unintentionally gloss over inequity and lead to invisible experiences. On the other hand, when analysts create a subgroup, they may be shifting the focus of analysis to a specific population that is likely already over-surveilled. (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration)\nEach decision has its benefits and limitations. No matter what analytical decision you make, it’s important to clearly document the reasoning behind your decision.\n\n\nSurvivorship Bias\n\nDrawing conclusions from an incomplete set of data, because that data has ‘survived’ some selection criteria.\nAs soon as we get our hands on a dataset it can be tempting to dive into analysis without taking the time to consider that data in the context of our project goals and objectives. Sometimes the data we need to understand every aspect of ideal our project objectives simply does not exist or is not accessible.\nIt’s important to take the time during the Plan and Prepare phase to understand what data are needed to achieve the objectives of your project, what data are actually available, and to understand what all of that means for your Collect and Process phase, and how that might impact your interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege of Water Informatics Machine Learning Handbook\nFlood M.

If there are gaps in that data you feed your analytical methods, there will be similar gaps in your results.\n\n\nPrescriptive Analytics\nRecommend actions or decisions.\nThe potential analytical methods are complex and require a large amount of quality and relevant data and computing power to be implemented appropriately. One should also consider the implications of the potential actions and decisions being considered using an equity lens. Striking the balance between data-driven insights and equity considerations is essential for advancing equity outcomes.\n\n\nCausal Analytics\nUnderstand the cause and effect relationships between variables of interest.\nAll causal analytical tools require strong assumptions and can never fully capture all of the context of the relationships in questions (i.e. extraneous variables that cannot be measured or assessed). If these methods are used, be sure to ground-truth the results with the communities the data you’re using are meant to represent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with any analysis, we need to understand the limits of our data and the methods we use so we interpret the results we find appropriately. Below is an overview of common data fallacies to be aware of and avoid as you’re interpreting your results and making conclusions1:\n\n\n\nData Fallacy\nDescription\nAdditional Equity Considerations\n\n\n\n\nCherry Picking\n\nSelecting results that fit your hypothesis or claim, and excluding those that don’t.\nThis doesn’t mean you should always keep all data you have access to (see Data Processing).\nIt’s important to be aware of data or results you are excluding and to be honest and transparent about why you’re excluding it.\n\n\nCobra Effect\n(aka Perverse Incentive)\n\nSetting an incentive that accidentally produces the opposite result to the one intended.\nThis is all about unintended consequences of our decisions and actions.\nWhen you’re developing your project objectives, be sure to take the Planning step seriously and take the time needed to answer as many of the questions provided as possible.\n\n\nDanger of Summary Metrics\n\nOnly looking at summary metrics and missing big differences in the raw data.\nSummary metrics or descriptive analytics can (and should!) be used to help us understand out data. However it’s important to remember that they cannot tell us anything about why we’re seeing the results, patterns, or trends that are identified. Be sure to use summary metrics in concert with context and other analyses so you can see your data holistically.\n\n\nData Dredging\n\nRepeatedly testing new hypotheses against the same set of data, failing to acknowledge that most correlations will be the result of chance.\nIt can be exciting to uncover meaningful and logical correlations when conducting your analyses.\nSimilar to cherry picking, it’s important to be aware of your analytical methods (and their limitations), and to be honest and transparent about your project objectives before you begin your analysis (see Plan and Prepare) as well as why you’re accepting or rejecting the results you get after analyses are conducted appropriately.\n\n\nFalse Causality\n\nFalsely assuming when two events appear related that one must have caused the other.\nThe classic: correlation does not imply causation. Adding context for which you don’t have data can help here. Discussing preliminary trends/results with partners and communities can help you ground truth the numerical results you’re seeing with the lived experiences of those that may be impacted by your project. See the Planning section on collecting expert input for more guidance on outreach and engagement.\n\n\nGambler’s Fallacy\n(aka Monte Carlo Fallacy)\n\nMistakenly believing that because something has happened more frequently than usual, it’s now less likely to happen in future (and vice versa).\nTo combat this fallacy it will be important to understand the context and “why” behind the results you are seeing. There are a number methods designed to help identify the the “why” (and there may be more than one reason!).\nSee the Evaluation section for guidance and remember that you don’t need to wait until the project is complete to benefit from using these evaluation tools! In fact, it may be helpful to use these tools at multiple points during your project or process.\n\n\nGerrymandering\n\nManipulating the geographical boundaries used to group data in order to change the result.\nThis is closely related to how you use geographical boundaries to aggregate or group your data. During your Plan and Prepare phase, think through what geographic units are most appropriate for your project needs. Know that the data you have access to might be in one geographic unit (e.g. census tract, hydrologic unit code (HUC)) but your questions are related to a different unit (e.g. county, region, statewide) - so you may need to do some analyses to standardize units. Doing so has its benefits and limitations. No matter what analytical decision you make, it’s important to clearly document the reasoning behind your decision.\n\n\nHawthorne Effect\n(aka Observer Effect)\n\nThe act of monitoring someone can affect their behavior, leading to spurious findings.\nThis may not be directly relevant in the usual data work you do. However, it is particularly important when delivering surveys. Keep that in mind as you design, deliver, and analyze survey results.\n\n\nMcNamara Fallacy\n\nRelying solely on metrics in complex situations and losing sight of the bigger picture.\nIt can be easy for some of us to get lost in the weeds of data analysis. What’s key here is to take a step back from time to time and continue to connect our analyses or product development back to the broader and contextualized project and equity goals you set for the project during your Plan and Prepare phase.\nWorking with and/or discussing your analytical process and/or preliminary trends/results with partners and communities can also help you ground truth the numerical results you’re seeing with the lived experiences of those that may be impacted by your project, and pull you out of the data weeds and back into context-informed data work.\n\n\nOverfitting\n\nCreating a model that’s overly tailored to the data you have and not representative of the general trend.\nUsing data to describe the environment and inform our decisions is complex, and is even more so when applying an equity lens to our data work. What’s important here is to keep this in mind as you develop, test, and interpret models for your analyses.\n\n\nPublication Bias\n\nInteresting research findings are more likely to be published, distorting our impression of reality.\nIt’s important to remember that academic systems - like our government systems and including publishing institutions - have racist origins and biases that have excluded the science, research, and ways of knowing that have come from of Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) communities. This is why taking the time to develop relationships and partnerships with the communities our decisions and actions may impact is crucial.\nIncluding partners with the expertise that can only come from lived experiences in our projects from the beginnig, and giving that expertise the same weight as academic or research expertise can broaden our perspectives and help prevent publication (and other biases) from negatively impacting our project, process and advancement of equity.\nSee the Planning section on collecting expert input for more guidance.\n\n\nRegression Towards the Mean\n\nWhen something happens that’s unusually good or bad, it will revert back towards the average over time.\nA key component of this fallacy is that random chance influences the outcome. When looking at our data through an equity lens, we need to remember that racism and injustice are central to our collective history and can be traced back to before the founding of our country. We live and work in institutions and systems that have inherited those unjust decisions and processes. We know that, as government representatives, if we’re not clear and intentional about advancing racial equity in the work we do, it won’t happen and we will continue to perpetuate racial inequity. In other words, because of the unjust systems in which we work, we cannot depend on this fallacy and wait for the unusually “bad” or unjust results/trends to correct themselves or revert back to more equitable trends. Because government agencies created and perpetuated environmental racism, it is our responsibility to proactively advance racial equity and justice in all the work we do.\nIf our collective history and its deep connection to racism and injustice are not familiar to you - we recommend taking the Advancing Racial Equity training series offered by the Water Boards Training Academy and reviewing the GARE Framework: Normalize, Organize, and Operationalize. More details on both of these actions and others can be found on the Getting Started page. |\n\n\nSampling Bias\n\nDrawing conclusions from a set of data that isn’t representative of the population you’re trying to understand.\nDuring your Plan and Prepare you will think through the type of data that’s needed to adequitely represent the populations related to your project objectives. If the data available is not adequately representative, then you may need to revise the types of questions you have of the data (and analytical methods). Or, it might be worth considering collecting the data yourself or with partners.\nNote that this principle and others can also be applied to surveys. Keep that in mind as you design, deliver, and analyze survey results.\n\n\nSimpson’s Paradox\n\nWhen a trend appears in different subsets of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.\nThis is critical when trying to understand and quantify how environmental outcomes might impact different groups. During your Plan and Prepare phase, think through the different ways you might aggregate or disaggregate your data and consider what is appropriate for the questions you have.\nWithout disaggregating data by subgroup, analysis can unintentionally gloss over inequity and lead to invisible experiences. On the other hand, when analysts create a subgroup, they may be shifting the focus of analysis to a specific population that is likely already over-surveilled. (Centering Racial Equity Throughout Data Integration)\nEach decision has its benefits and limitations. No matter what analytical decision you make, it’s important to clearly document the reasoning behind your decision.\n\n\nSurvivorship Bias\n\nDrawing conclusions from an incomplete set of data, because that data has ‘survived’ some selection criteria.\nAs soon as we get our hands on a dataset it can be tempting to dive into analysis without taking the time to consider that data in the context of our project goals and objectives. Sometimes the data we need to understand every aspect of ideal our project objectives simply does not exist or is not accessible.\nIt’s important to take the time during the Plan and Prepare phase to understand what data are needed to achieve the objectives of your project, what data are actually available, and to understand what all of that means for your Collect and Process phase, and how that might impact your interpretation.",

Best practices for this phase include:\n\nNot rushing through this phase! We often want to dive straight into “doing something” and taking the time to plan can feel like a waste of time. If done quickly and without using an equity lens, it will be time wasted. Instead, invest the time needed to do this phase well, rather than fast.\nUsing this phase to begin the process of trust and relationship building with Tribes, communities, and other expert partners interested in your project. Maybe it involves some early outreach, putting together an email list, establishing a technical advisory committee, or otherwise co-creating your planning documents with the communities that will be most impacted by the project’s implementation.\nMake the products developed during this phase as open, transparent, and accessible as possible and appropriate. This doesn’t necessarily mean that every single thing should be made public - but it does mean seriously considering what can be made open, to whom, and when.\nUse the best available science while relying on current, generally accepted Agency procedures for conducting risk assessments, economic or other technical analysis. But also understand that just because something has “always been done this way” does not automatically make it the best science, method, or process available. Be open to integrating other ways of knowing that might be different from “western science” or our business as usual methods or processes, such as the traditional knowledge landscape, and non-tribal expertise that stems from lived experiences.\n\n\n\n\nThis phase involves collecting the data and information you need for your project (Data Collection) and making it tidy so that is ready to be used in your analyses or product development steps (Data Processing). Best practices for this phase include:\n\nUse already existing and available frameworks and data, supplementing as appropriate.\nCarefully select and justify the choice of the geographic unit you will use in your analysis and discuss any particular challenges or potential aggregation issues related to the choice of spatial scale.\nKeep data disaggregated so you are able to reveal important spatial differences during your analysis phase (e.g., demographic information for each facility/place) when feasible and appropriate.\nPrepare to invest the time required to tidy the data needed for your project. It’s commonly understood in the data science field that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data (Dasu and Johnson 2003) - expect the same will be true for your project and prepare to invest time and resources accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nRemember - this phase is all about….

Creating and agreeing upon a common language can help foster transparency, challenge assumptions, and center the voices of marginalized communities; yet the efficiency of these efforts hinges on a shared language that facilitates understanding and collaboration. By grounding discussions in a common language, we can build trust and empower our team and community.\nEstablishing a common language and definitions are critical to creating a shared understanding, however we acknowledge that language can be used deliberately to engage and support community anti-racism coalitions and initiatives, or to inflame and divide them. It is important to note that although the language in this Handbook may be commonly used, the list of terms herein is not exhaustive, and may not be the sole definition of a term, and some may disagree with the definitions and their use. More specifically, in this resource we intentionally use the acronym BIPoC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) as a term that seeks to recognize the unique experience of Black and Indigenous People within the United States. We recognize that naming is power, and we remain committed to using language that supports pro-Blackness and Native visibility, while dismantling white supremacy.\nBelow we have included a Glossary and Non-Inclusive Terms to Avoid to establish a common language within the Guidance Document as it relates to Racial Equity. In addition, data terms used throughout the Guidance document will be defined as they arise on the following pages. A more extensive list of data terms and definitions can also be found on the College of Water Informatics Data Glossary page.\n\n\nBelow are a set of key terms and definitions provided by the Water Board Racial Equity Team in the development of the Racial Equity Resolution and Racial Equity Action Plan and are those that we adhere to in this document. (citations can be found here). For a more comprehensive list of equity-related terms, see the Racial Equity Tools Glossary\n\nDisadvantaged Community (DAC) is defined by the California Water Code as a community in which the median household income (MHI) is less than 80 percent of the statewide annual MHI (CA Water Code Section 13149.2 and 79505.5(a)). At the time this document was developed, the statewide annual MHI from the U.S. Census Bureau from 2017-2021 was $84,097 (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: California). Based on this data, a community with a household income of less than $67,278 qualifies as a DAC based on the Water Code definition.\nEquality describes circumstances in which each individual or group is given the same or equal treatment, including the same resources, opportunities, and support. However, because different individuals or groups have different histories, needs, and circumstances, they do not have equal positions in society or starting points. Providing the same resources, support, or treatment does not guarantee that everyone will have fair or equal outcomes.\nEthnicity is a term used to describe subgroups of a population that share characteristics such as language, values, behavioral patterns, history, and ancestral geographical base. Social scientists often use the terms ethnicity and ethnic group to avoid the perception of biological significance associated with race.\nIntersectionality is a term used to describe the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine, overlap and intersect especially in the experiences of marginalized individuals or groups.\nInstitutional racism describes the ways in which policies and practices perpetuated by institutions, including governments and private groups, produce different outcomes for different racial groups in a manner that benefits the dominant group. In the United States, institutional racism includes policies that may not mention race but still result in benefiting white people over people of color.\nRace is a social construct used to categorize humans into groups based on combinations of shared physical traits such as skin color, hair texture, nose shape, eye shape, or head shape. Although most scientists agree that such groupings lack biological meaning, racial groups continue to have a strong influence over contemporary social relations. Historically in the United States, race has frequently been used to concentrate power with white people and legitimize dominance over non-white people.\nRacial equity means Race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved. For example, when we hold income constant, there are still large inequities based on race across multiple indicators for success, including the environment, education, jobs, incarceration, health and housing. \nRacism is any prejudice against someone because of their race when systems of power reinforce those views. \nStructural racism is the normalization and legitimization of an array of historical, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal dynamics that routinely advantage whites while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for people of color. Structural racism encompasses the entire system of white domination, diffused, and infused in all aspects of society, including its history, culture, politics, economics, and whole social fabric. Structural racism is more difficult to locate in a particular institution because it involves the reinforcing effects of multiple institutions and cultural norms, past and present, continually reproducing old and producing new forms of racism. Structural racism is the most profound and pervasive form of racism; all other forms of racism emerge from structural racism.\nSystemic racism can be said to encompass both institutional and structural racism. Glenn Harris, president of Race Forward, defines systemic racism as “the complex interaction of culture, policy and institutions that holds in place the outcomes we see in our lives.”  The legacy of systemic racism can be seen in a variety of outcomes affecting people of color, such as housing insecurity, a ten-fold wealth gap between white and Black or Latinx households, a dramatic over-representation of people of color in prison, and disparities in education, health, and exposure to environmental pollution.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are a set of common terms that are non-inclusive particularly to Black and Indigenous People and are commonly used in the workplace that have . This is not an exhaustive list but we recommend that research be conducted to review non-inclusive terms that may be used and have a history prior to engaging with communities. A good resource to start with is the University of Arizona’s Antiracist language guide.\n\nBlacklist - Blacklist typically refers to the ostracizing of a person, group, or organization that prevents them from participating in specific activities or spaces. This issue with the word blacklist is the association of the color with negative, evil, or wrong, and the racist undertones associated with it, and can be harmful.\n\nAlternatives: blocked, closed off, inaccessible, blocked list, banned, or closed list\n\nBrown Bag - The term “brown bag” has a historical connotation with creating an exclusive gathering that required attendees to have a lighter skin tone than a brown paper bag to participate and gain access.\n\nAlternatives: lunch in, lunch and learn, presentation, seminar\n\nChief - this term is used throughout the Water Boards to indicate positions and job titles.  This term is appropriated from the Indigenous Peoples of North America and should be avoided wherever possible.\n\nAlternatives: manager, lead, head\n\nGrandfathered in - The American South created absurd voting requirements that targeted Black people and made it almost impossible to vote. The name for these requirements is the “Grandfather Clause.” They wrote the Amendment in a way to imply the practice was not discriminatory. They created stringent new voter requirements such as literacy tests. These requirements did not apply to people who had voted before 1867. Slaves did not know they were free until June 19, 1865. However, slavery was abolished on January 1, 1863, making it nearly impossible for a person formally kept in captivity to be legally allowed to vote.\n\nAlternatives:  legacied, exempted, preapproved\n\nMaster ____ - using the term “master” to describe something that is the main or centralized source of information is inappropriate due to the connotations associated with slavery.\n\nAlternatives: primary, main\n\nPow wow - Social gatherings for ceremonial and celebratory purposes conducted under strict protocols. Avoid using the phrase to refer to a quick business meeting or informal social gathering as this is a form of cultural appropriation.\n\nAlternatives: meeting, gathering, or huddle\n\nSpirit Animal - These are spiritual guides that take the form of animals often viewed as sacred in tribal cultures. Non-native people appropriate the term to relate themselves to an animal, inanimate object, or person and draw parallels between the person and object’s characteristics. For example, saying that a sloth is your spirit animal because you are slow, lazy, and/or sleepy.\n\nAlternatives: patronus, kindred spirit, reason for living, muse, guide, or familiar.\n\nTotem Pole - Pieces of wood carved with a person’s totems. It is a tradition particular to Native and Indigenous people on the Northwest Coast. They tend to convey a family or tribe’s history. Avoid using phrases like “low on the totem pole” or “climbing the totem pole” as these are forms of cultural appropriation. These phrases are also inaccurate because in some First Nation communities being lower on the totem pole is a higher honor.\n\nAlternatives: climbing the corporate ladder, the lowest rung on the latter, least significant, or promotion.\n\nWhite Paper - while this term is widely used to describe an authoritative document, the term has historical implications that evoke negative associations especially with Tribes. \n\nAlternatives: Issue paper, briefing document, prospectus",
