    "text": "Welcome!\nThis is an online User Manual for the California Water Board’s Tribal Water Data Map (Map), written by the California State Water Resources Control Board’s (State Water Board) Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA).\nThe purpose of the Map is to increase awareness of and access to the Water Board’s water data resources that intersect with Tribal matters and needs. The interactive Map includes curated data layers that have been requested by tribal partners and that may be useful for California Native American Tribes (tribes) doing environmental or water related work.\nThe purpose of this User Manual is to provide guidance and context so it’s easier for all audiences to use the Map. Content in this User Manual includes curated information that the has been requested by tribal partners and/or that the development Team thinks may be helpful to reference when using the map.\nThis Quarto book is an open, living, and continuously iterating resource. If you have suggestions for additions or revisions you think should be incorporated into this book, please follow the guidance provided in the Contributing chapter."

The Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) integrates multiple legacy systems (e.g., CERCLIS, ICTS, SDMS) into a comprehensive tracking and reporting tool, providing data on the inventory of active and archived hazardous waste sites evaluated by the Superfund program. It contains sites that are either proposed to be, or are on, the National Priorities List (NPL) as well as sites that are in the screening and assessment phase for possible inclusion on the NPL. The data provided in this service are obtained from EPA’s Facility Registry Service (FRS). The FRS is an integrated source of comprehensive (air, water, and waste) environmental information about facilities, sites or places. This service connects directly to the FRS database to provide this data as a feature service.

By connecting EPA users with curated datasets and promoting service reuse, SEGS aims to enhance information access, reduce data-storage costs, and improve the consistency and quality of data at the US EPA. This GIS dataset contains polygons depicting U.S. EPA Superfund Site boundaries. Site boundaries are polygons representing the footprint of a whole site, defined for purposes of this effort as the sum of all of the Operable Units and the current understanding of the full extent of contamination. For Federal Facility sites, the total site polygon may be the Facility boundary. As site investigation and remediation progress, OUs may be added, modified or refined, and the total site polygon should be updated accordingly. Superfund features are managed by regional teams of geospatial professionals and remedial program managers (RPMs), and SEGS harvests regional data on a weekly basis to refresh the national dataset and feature services. EPA is interested in your feedback on this item and the SEGS collection. Please share any feedback to the SEGS Administrative Team at SEGServices@epa.gov.\n\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)"

Detailed documentation of these changes is provided by FMMP and included in the lineage section of the metadata.\n\nA dataset was made available (approximately 2004) through CALFIRE - FRAP and the California Spatial Information Library (CaSIL), with additional updates throughout subsequent years. More recently, an effort was made to improve the coastal linework by using the previous interior linework from the 24k data, but replacing the coastal linework based on NOAA’s ERMA coastal dataset (which used NAIP 2010).\n\nIn this dataset, all bays (plus bay islands and constructed features) are merged into the mainland, and coastal features (such as islands and constructed features) are not included, with the exception of the Channel Islands which ARE included.\nThis service represents the latest released version, and is updated when new versions are released. As of June, 2019 it represents cnty19_1.\n\nSource: California Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFIRE)\n\n\n3.5.3 State Park Boundaries\nThis layer shows the State Parks in California.\nCalifornia State Parks generates eight GIS datasets for public use. \nThese datasets and materials (“Materials”) have been developed by the State of California, Department of Parks and Recreation (“DPR”) for uses beneficial to DPR and as a public service to enhance open government, transparency and accountability.
