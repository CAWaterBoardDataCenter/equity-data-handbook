# Plan & Prepare

# Don't forget to publish your data!

If you are a steward of Water Boards data - and it is not yet made appropriately open and accessible (including thorough documentation and complete metadata!) - you should complete the guidance on the [Publish Your Data page](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/publish-data.html) before you begin thinking about planning for your project.

Before data collection begins, it is paramount that you think through *why* you want to collect the data you think you need and *how* you intend to use it once it is collected.

This phase of the data life cycle involves conducting an equity assessment ([Planning](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/plan.html)) and developing your data management plan using an equity lens ([Data Preparation](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/prep.html)).

Also see a [short list of best practices for this phase](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/get-started/best-practice.html#plan-prepare).
