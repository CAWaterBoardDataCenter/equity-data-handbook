# Demographics Data

Adding demographics data to your data project can help increase understanding of potential correlations or relationships between your data and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of locations of interest. More specifically, the integration of demographics data into your data project can highlight the extent to which race can still be used to predict outcomes associated with your project and therefore underscore where and to what extent racial equity outcomes have not yet been achieved.

#### **Demographics Data Integration Methods**

Depending on what demographics data sources you decide to use, the methods needed to combine, overlay, or compare with the data you are interested in may vary. Below we outline methods of comparing demographics data to point, line, and polygon data types.

## Before you dive in

Think through what questions you have and what data would be the best to use to answer that questions

data isn't people

be sure to understand limitations / bias of data you use

-   who collected it? what were their original intentions/questions

Remember - there's no such thing as "equity data" - how we use data, interpret it, and act on what we learn makes our use equitable (or not).

### Key Terms

Demographics

-   Race

-   Ethnicity

Geographies

-   Block

-   Block Group

-   Tract

Census Data

Tidyverse: the R package we'll be using to organize and prepare data for use \[add link to tidyverse documentation\]

We''ll be running through examples below in R -

link to intro to R4WDS training

use R Projects

use the here package (instead of explicitly setting working directory - makes it more shareable and reproducible

### Download Packages

census API key sign up link: <https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>

## Collecting Data

CalEnviroScreen vs Census Data - add table that compares difference sources to make it easier for folks to understand which tool is best for the job

-   geographies

-   last data update

-   age categories

-   

pull over content + code from: <https://datamade.github.io/waterboard-coaching/>

Take some time to review the Concept and Labels in the table -

```         
summary_var = "P2_001N" # Total population
```

### Demographics data sources

-   census data in R & Python

non-census data (e.g. CalEnviroScreen)

### Common tables to use in sources

## Data Prep & Use

### Point Data

```` r

code-annotations: below

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                      # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <2>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <2>
  )                                              # <2>
```
1. Take `penguins`, and then,
2. add new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.

### Lines
