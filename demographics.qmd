# Demographics Data

Adding demographics data to your data project can help increase understanding of potential correlations or relationships between your data and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of locations of interest.

Depending on what demographics data sources you decide to use, the methods needed to combine, overlay, or compare with the data you are interested in may vary. Below we outline methods of comparing demographics data to point, line, and polygon data types.

## Before you dive in

Think through what questions you have and what data would be the best to use to answer that questions

data isn't people

be sure to understand limitations / bias of data you use

-   who collected it? what were their original intentions/questions

Remember - there's no such thing as "equity data" - how we use, interpret data and act on what we learn makes our use equitable (or not)

### Common tables to use in sources

## Data Prep & Use

### Point Data

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                      # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <2>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <2>
  )                                              # <2>
```
1. Take `penguins`, and then,
2. add new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.

### Lines

### Polygons
