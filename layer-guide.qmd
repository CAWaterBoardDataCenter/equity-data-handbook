Native Land Digital strives to create and foster conversations about the history of colonialism, Indigenous ways of knowing, and settler-Indigenous relations, through educational resources such as our map and Territory Acknowledgement Guide. We strive to go beyond old ways of talking about Indigenous people and to develop a platform where Indigenous communities can represent themselves and their histories on their own terms. In doing so, Native Land Digital creates spaces where non-Indigenous people can be invited and challenged to learn more about the lands they inhabit, the history of those lands, and how to actively be part of a better future going forward together.

### Tribal Census Tract 2021

## Environmental Data Layers

### 2020-2022 Integrated Report (linear)

This layer shows the 2020-2022 Integrated Report for linear waterbodies in California, such as rivers, streams, and beaches.

![](images/layer-guide_integrated-report-linear.png)

State Water Resources Control Board Division of Water Quality staff have developed this map to graphically display the waterbodies assessed in the 2020-2022 California Integrated Report. This map contains waterbodies assessed for 305(b) categorization, including those placed on the 303(d) list of impaired waters.

Note, these are not the final assessments.

Data Update Frequency: Every two years

### Integrated Report (non-linear) 2020-2022

This layer shows a spatial representation of the 2020-2022 Integrated Report-non-linear (polygon) waterbodies in California, such as bays, lakes, and reservoirs.

### CalEnviroScreen 4.0

This layer shows the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 based on the CL Score percentile (ClscoreP).

CalEnviroScreen is a screening methodology that can be used to help identify California communities that are disproportionately burdened by multiple sources of pollution.

## Environmental Justice Layers

### Superfund Sites

This layer shows Superfund Site locations and data on the inventory of active and archived hazardous waste sites evaluated by the EPA's Superfund program.

![](images/layer-guide_superfund-sites.png)

This data provides location and attribute information on Facilities regulated under the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS). It contains sites that are either proposed to be, or are on, the National Priorities List (NPL) as well as sites that are in the screening and assessment phase for possible inclusion on the NPL.
