# Layer Guide

This guide serves to provide greater detail about each layer included in the Tribal Water Data Map including the source of the data.

## Tribal Land Layers

### Indigenous Territories

Layer displaying historic Indigenous Territories within California.

Native Land Digital strives to create and foster conversations about the history of colonialism, Indigenous ways of knowing, and settler-Indigenous relations, through educational resources such as our map and Territory Acknowledgement Guide. We strive to go beyond old ways of talking about Indigenous people and to develop a platform where Indigenous communities can represent themselves and their histories on their own terms. In doing so, Native Land Digital creates spaces where non-Indigenous people can be invited and challenged to learn more about the lands they inhabit, the history of those lands, and how to actively be part of a better future going forward together.

### Indian Lands and Native Entities

Layer showing American Indians Reservations/Federally Recognized Tribal Entities.

The American Indians Reservations/Federally Recognized Tribal Entities dataset depicts feature location, selected demographics and other associated data for the 561 Federally Recognized Tribal entities in the contiguous U.S. and Alaska. Categories included are: American Indian Reservations (AIR), Federally Recognized Tribal Entities (FRTE) and Alaska Native Villages (ANV).

The American Indian Reservations / Federally Recognized Tribal Entities dataset was compiled using USGS 7.5' quadrangle maps (1:24,000), Bureau of Census 1995 TIGER data sets (1:100,000), Bureau of Census 2000 TIGER data sets (1:100,000),Bureau of Census 2004 TIGER data sets (1:100,000), BIA Pacific and Alaska Regional Office coverages (1:24,000 ) and the GDSC-developed Land Title Mapper (LTM) (1:24,000).

## Environmental Justice Layers

### Superfund Sites

This layer shows Superfund Sites from EPA's Facility Registry Service (FRS).

This data provides location and attribute information on Facilities regulated under the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS). The Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) integrates multiple legacy systems (e.g., CERCLIS, ICTS, SDMS) into a comprehensive tracking and reporting tool, providing data on the inventory of active and archived hazardous waste sites evaluated by the Superfund program. It contains sites that are either proposed to be, or are on, the National Priorities List (NPL) as well as sites that are in the screening and assessment phase for possible inclusion on the NPL. The data provided in this service are obtained from EPA's Facility Registry Service (FRS). The FRS is an integrated source of comprehensive (air, water, and waste) environmental information about facilities, sites or places. This service connects directly to the FRS database to provide this data as a feature service. FRS creates high-quality, accurate, and authoritative facility identification records through rigorous verification and management procedures that incorporate information from program national systems, state master facility records, data collected from EPA's Central Data Exchange registrations and data management personnel.

### NPL Superfund Site Boundaries

This layer shows entire Superfund Site Boundaries.

Shared Enterprise Geodata and Services (SEGS) provides an EPA-curated collection of recommended geodata assets that are nationally relevant and support the Agency\'s mission to protect human health and the environment. By connecting EPA users with curated datasets and promoting service reuse, SEGS aims to enhance information access, reduce data-storage costs, and improve the consistency and quality of data at the US EPA. This GIS dataset contains polygons depicting U.S. EPA Superfund Site boundaries. Site boundaries are polygons representing the footprint of a whole site, defined for purposes of this effort as the sum of all of the Operable Units and the current understanding of the full extent of contamination. For Federal Facility sites, the total site polygon may be the Facility boundary. As site investigation and remediation progress, OUs may be added, modified or refined, and the total site polygon should be updated accordingly. Superfund features are managed by regional teams of geospatial professionals and remedial program managers (RPMs), and SEGS harvests regional data on a weekly basis to refresh the national dataset and feature services. EPA is interested in your feedback on this item and the SEGS collection. Please share any feedback to the SEGS Administrative Team at SEGServices\@epa.gov.

## Other State or Local Government Layers

### County Boundaries

This layer shows County Boundaries within California.

This layer provides an initial offering as "best available" at 1:24,000 scale.

In late 1996, the Dept of Conservation (DOC) surveyed state and federal agencies about the county boundary coverage they used. As a result, DOC adopted the 1:24,000 (24K) scale U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) dataset (USGS source) for their Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) but with several modifications. Detailed documentation of these changes is provided by FMMP and included in the lineage section of the metadata.

\
A dataset was made available (approximately 2004) through CALFIRE - FRAP and the California Spatial Information Library (CaSIL), with additional updates throughout subsequent years. More recently, an effort was made to improve the coastal linework by using the previous interior linework from the 24k data, but replacing the coastal linework based on NOAA's ERMA coastal dataset (which used NAIP 2010).\
\
In this dataset, all bays (plus bay islands and constructed features) are merged into the mainland, and coastal features (such as islands and constructed features) are not included, with the exception of the Channel Islands which ARE included.

This service represents the latest released version, and is updated when new versions are released. As of June, 2019 it represents cnty19_1.

### State Park Boundaries

This layer shows the State Parks in California.

California State Parks generates eight GIS datasets for public use. 

These datasets and materials (\"Materials\") have been developed by the State of California, Department of Parks and Recreation (\"DPR\") for uses beneficial to DPR and as a public service to enhance open government, transparency and accountability. DPR is also known as California State Parks (\"CSP\").\
All Materials are made available on an \"as is\" basis, on the express condition that users who view, download, transfer or otherwise access or use the Materials expressly accept these Terms of Use and Disclaimers
