# Documentation

Remember: if your project or process is not well-documented to the point of being largely reproducible - it's incomplete!

## Why Document?

Documentation is a critical to improving transparency, clarity, and consistency of products and process. When done well, documentation can significantly reduce the amount of time wasted by team members, partners, the public (and ourselves!) who are looking for answers, institutional knowledge, or process and eliminate unnecessary duplication of work.

Panel 4 shows the second person looking blankly at the computer monitor." width="412"}

Detailed documentation of every aspect of a project and all phases of the data and project life cycle - from planning, to data sources, analysis methods, code, workflows, and even why decisions were made - is critical because it helps ensure that data, results, and products are meaningful, accessible, and actionable for our teams, partners, communities, and the public. Documentation in our data-intensive workflows can also help identify areas of improvement in how we work with ourselves and others, and make it easier to identify solutions and other paths forward. Moreover, clear documentation also allows us to pick up where we left off, or easily transition projects from one person or team to another when roles or positions change thus preventing the loss of incredibly valuable institutional knowledge that only comes with time and experience. Without proper documentation, it can be difficult for others to have confidence in, ground truth/validate, or build on existing work.

Individuals and teams that invest the time to create clear and complete documentation tend to find projects to be a bit more manageable because they have resources to guide them; over the long-term, that investment into documentation can also increase the reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility of their work. All of this, in turn, can help build relationships and trust with partners and communities impacted by the project thus helping to operationalize equity into our projects, products, and process.

## Documenting with an Equity Lens

**Reproducibility:** Reproducibility is a vital aspect of documentation that plays a key role in promoting data equity. When research is documented in a way that allows others to replicate findings, it ensures that not folks can access and validate the data as part of their understanding and workflow. Ultimately, effective documentation that emphasizes reproducibility fosters trust and collaboration, paving the way for a more equitable data landscape.

**Transparency:** Transparency in documentation is particularly vital for building trust with communities that have historically experienced a lack of openness or consideration in the past. By prioritizing transparent documentation, researchers can clearly communicate their methodologies, data sources, and findings, allowing communities to understand how decisions are made and how data impacts them or others. This openness not only empowers communities to engage meaningfully with research but also helps to rebuild trust, ensuring that their voices are respected and included in future studies. Ultimately, transparency is essential for fostering collaborative relationships and promoting equity in data-driven initiatives.

**Accessibility**: When research is presented in ways that center accessibility—such as offering offline materials, using multiple languages, or documenting in [plain language](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/assure-analyze/vis.html#use-plain-accessible-and-inclusive-language)—it empowers individuals to participate and engage. This effort not only increases access to vital information but also demonstrates a genuine commitment to inclusivity and respect for diverse experiences. By prioritizing accessibility, documentation can help bridge gaps in communication and understanding, ultimately fostering trust and collaboration with communities that have historically been sidelined.
