# Documentation

Add guidance on documentation, reproducibility & transparency, oh my!

This is intended to be a living document and providing documentation is extremely important.

Remember - if your project or process is not well-documented to the point of being largely reproducible - it's incomplete!

## Why Document?

Documentation is a critical to improving transparency, ensuring when roles or positions change data and information is not lost. Detailed documentation of data sources, analysis methods, and code is also critical to equity because it helps ensure that data is meaningful, accessible, and actionable for communities. Without proper documentation, it can be difficult for others to validate or build on existing analyses. Clear documentation also allows us to pick up where we left off, or easily transition data projects from one team to another. Documentation in our data workflow can also help identify areas of improvement in workflows and paths forward. Projects are more manageable, with clear documentation and over the long-term, documentation can increase transparency and equity.

## Documenting with and Equity Lens

**Reproducibility:** Reproducibility is a vital aspect of documentation that plays a key role in promoting data equity. When research is documented in a way that allows others to replicate findings, it ensures that not folks can access and validate the data as part of their understanding and workflow. Ultimately, effective documentation that emphasizes reproducibility fosters trust and collaboration, paving the way for a more equitable data landscape.

**Transparency:** Transparency in documentation is particularly vital for building trust with communities that have historically experienced a lack of openness or consideration in the past. By prioritizing transparent documentation, researchers can clearly communicate their methodologies, data sources, and findings, allowing communities to understand how decisions are made and how data impacts them or others. This openness not only empowers communities to engage meaningfully with research but also helps to rebuild trust, ensuring that their voices are respected and included in future studies. Ultimately, transparency is essential for fostering collaborative relationships and promoting equity in data-driven initiatives.

**Accessibility**: When research is presented in ways that center accessibility—such as offering offline materials, using multiple languages, or documenting in [plain language](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/assure-analyze/vis.html#use-plain-accessible-and-inclusive-language)—it empowers individuals to participate and engage. This effort not only increases access to vital information but also demonstrates a genuine commitment to inclusivity and respect for diverse experiences. By prioritizing accessibility, documentation can help bridge gaps in communication and understanding, ultimately fostering trust and collaboration with communities that have historically been sidelined.
