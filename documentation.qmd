# Documentation

Add guidance on documentation, reproducibility & transparency, oh my!

This is intended to be a living document and providing documentation is extremely important.

Remember - if your project or process is not well-documented to the point of being largely reproducible - it's incomplete!

## Why Document? 

Documentation is a critical to improving transparency, ensuring when roles or positions change data and information is not lost. Clear documentation also allows us to pick up where we left off, or easily transition data projects from one team to another. Clear documentation in our data workflow can help identify areas of improvement in workflows and paths forward.

## What do we Document?
