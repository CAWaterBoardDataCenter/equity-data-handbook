## Consult the Racial Equity Data Team

Program staff that are beginning data project using a racial equity lens should meet with the Racial Equity Data Team to discuss key aspects of the project including who the audience is and what questions or information you are trying to convey using the available racial equity data. *This engagement should occur prior to beginning any data collection or analysis.*

To initiate a consultation with the Racial Equity Data Team, please send an email to [equitydatahelp\@waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:equitydatahelp@waterboards.ca.gov). 

## Review the Equity Data Handbook and complete the Racial Equity Data Project Form

This [Equity Data Handbook](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/) is a curated compilation of emerging and comprehensive (but not exhaustive) guidance on:  

-   How to break down the management questions where racial equity information is being posed against administrative data; and 
-   How to apply equity best practices during each phase of the data life cycle to begin an iterative process into advancing racial equity. 

This Handbook is specifically structured to support Water Boards staff on incorporating racial equity concepts into all phases of their data projects. The guidance and best practices provided serves as a strategic guide emphasizing the importance of collection, analysis and utilization of racial equity data.

These intended users of this Handbook include, but are not limited to:  

-   Program Staff
-   Program managers
-   Executives
-   Agency Partners
-   Tribal Governments
-   The Public 

After reviewing this Handbook, please complete the [Racial Equity Data Project Form](https://forms.office.com/g/0HuJqQkiJs) so that the Racial Equity Data Team is better equipped for your project consultation.

## Review the GARE Framework

It's songly suggested staff review the [framework outlined by the Government Alliance for Racial Equity (GARE)](https://www.racialequityalliance.org/viewdocument/racial-equity-toolkit-an-opportuni-2) to normalize, organize, and operationalize racial equity throughout data integration (see image below). In addition to why it is important to [lead with race](https://www.racialequityalliance.org/about/our-approach/race/):

> “with the recognition that the creation and perpetuation of racial inequities has been baked into government, and that racial inequities across all indicators for success are deep and pervasive. We also know that other groups of people are still marginalized, including based on gender, sexual orientation, ability and age, to name but a few. Focusing on racial equity provides the opportunity to introduce a framework, tools and resources that can also be applied to other areas of marginalization.It is critical to address all areas of marginalization, and an institutional approach is necessary across the board. As the local and regional government deepens its ability to eliminate racial inequity, it will be better equipped to transform systems and institutions impacting other marginalized groups.”
