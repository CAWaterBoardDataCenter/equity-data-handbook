# Getting Started

Program staff that are beginning a racial equity based data project should meet with the Racial Equity Data Team to discuss key aspects of the project including who the audience is and what questions or information you are trying to convey using the available racial equity data. This engagement should occur prior to beginning any analysis or data collection. To initiate a consultation with the Racial Equity Data Team, please send an email to [equitydatahelp\@waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:equitydatahelp@waterboards.ca.gov). 

This Best Practices and Guidance handbook is a blend of emerging, comprehensive guidance on:  

-   How to break down the management questions where racial equity information is being posed against administrative data; and

```
-   How to apply best practices on data use, data visualization and storytelling to begin an iterative process into Advancing Racial Equity. 

This resource is specifically structured to support Water Boards staff on incorporating racial equity concepts into the planning and design of data collection methods and visualizations (e.g., maps, factsheets, etc.) projects. The guidance and best practices provided serves as a strategic guide emphasizing the importance of collection, analysis and utilization of racial equity data.

These users could include: 

-   Program Staff
-   Program managers
-   Executives
-   Agency Partners
-   Tribal Governments
-   The Public 

Furthermore, we strongly suggest staff review the following [framework outlined by the Government Alliance for Racial Equity (GARE)](https://www.racialequityalliance.org/viewdocument/racial-equity-toolkit-an-opportuni-2) to normalize, organize, and operationalize racial equity throughout data integration (see image below). In addition to why it is important to [lead with race](https://www.racialequityalliance.org/about/our-approach/race/):

> “with the recognition that the creation and perpetuation of racial inequities has been baked into government, and that racial inequities across all indicators for success are deep and pervasive. We also know that other groups of people are still marginalized, including based on gender, sexual orientation, ability and age, to name but a few. Focusing on racial equity provides the opportunity to introduce a framework, tools and resources that can also be applied to other areas of marginalization.It is critical to address all areas of marginalization, and an institutional approach is necessary across the board. As the local and regional government deepens its ability to eliminate racial inequity, it will be better equipped to transform systems and institutions impacting other marginalized groups.”

Furthermore, we recommend staff take the Advancing Racial Equity training series offered by the [Water Boards Training Academy](https://launcher.myapps.microsoft.com/api/signin/82768508-b765-4d4e-bc76-c73262ddb0cf?tenantId=fe186a25-7d49-41e6-9941-05d2281d36c1) to foster a consistent baseline knowledge of racial equity work and the importance of applying a racial equity lens to our work.
