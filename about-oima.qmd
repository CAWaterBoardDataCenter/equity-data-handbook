# About OIMA

## Overview

The California State Water Resources Control Board's ([State Water Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/)) Office of Information Management and Analysis ([OIMA](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/)), serves as an advocate for data management, a bridge between data collectors and users, and provides transparency of the Water Board's information management infrastructure.

> OIMA's goal is to collaborate monitoring efforts, accurately analyze data, make our data easily accessible, and create visualizations and reports that make data understandable across all audiences.

## Tribal Water Data Initiatives

OIMA is committed to [advancing equity](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/racial_equity/resolution-and-actions.html), inclusion, and belonging in our work, our office, and at the Water Boards. Meaningful engagement and partnership with California Native American Tribes (tribes) is fundamental to this work.

OIMA has begun to work with Tribal partners on a series of water data initiatives \-- including the [Tribal Water Data Map](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/home/item.html?id=a71c1841907240e1a4d896c8cf2302a8) and this [User Manual](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/tribal-water-data-map-manual/) \-- to build relationships and work together to better understand, streamline, and improve the interactions between Water Board data systems and those of our Tribal government partners.
