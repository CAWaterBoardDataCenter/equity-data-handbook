# Best Practices

-   Use the best available science while relying on current, generally accepted Agency procedures for conducting risk assessment and economic analysis.  

-   Use existing frameworks and data from other parts of the regulatory analysis, supplemented as appropriate.  

-   Be consistent with the basic assumptions underlying other parts of the analysis, such as using the same baseline and option scenarios.

-   Use the highest quality and most recent data available. Discuss the overall quality and main limitations of the data (e.g., completeness, accuracy, validation). 

-   Discuss available evidence of factors that may make population groups of concern more vulnerable to adverse effects (e.g., unique pathways; cumulative exposure from multiple stressors; and behavioral, biological, or environmental factors that increase susceptibility). 

-    Identify unique considerations for subsistence populations when relevant. 

-   Carefully select and justify the choice of a comparison population group.  

-   Carefully select and justify the choice of the geographic unit of analysis and discuss any particular challenges or aggregation issues related to the choice of spatial scale.

-   Analyze and compare effects in baseline and across policy scenarios to show differences in effects.

-   Present summary metrics for relevant population groups of concern as well as the comparison population group. 

-   When data allow, characterize the distribution of risks, exposures, or outcomes within each population group, instead of presenting only average effects. 

-   Disaggregate data to reveal important spatial differences (e.g., demographic information for each facility/place) when feasible and appropriate.

-   Discuss the severity and nature of the health consequences for which differences between population groups have been analyzed. 

-   Clearly describe data sources, assumptions, analytic techniques, and results. 

-   Discuss key sources of uncertainty or potential biases in the data (e.g., sample size, using proximity as a surrogate for exposure) and how they may influence results.

-   When possible, conduct sensitivity analysis for key assumptions or parameters that may affect findings. 

-   Make elements of Environmental Justice (EJ) assessments as straightforward and easy for the public to understand as possible.
