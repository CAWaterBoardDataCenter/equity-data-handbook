# Data Visualization

Effective data visualizations - the ones that stick with us, can help us understand complex issues, and those that encourage us to change our behaviors and actions to be more equitable, inclusive, and kind - they are more that points on a map. Great data visualizations are communication tools that are user-centered and tell a compelling story that connects with the audience.

When thinking of the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom graphic at the top of the [Data Analysis](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/assure-analyze/analysis.html) page - data visualizations are one tool we can use to add context and meaning to data to create information and knowledge. Ideally, the insights gleaned from our visualizations can then be used to make data and equity-informed decisions and to take effective and impactful action.

## Data Visualization with an Equity Lens

When it comes to creating data visualizations with an equity lens, it boils down to making decisions that consider equity and inclusion in the way results are shown/communicated and that promote accessibility of the data, information, and tool as a whole. As you develop your data visualization or equivalent application - be sure to keep the below considerations in mind and make data, communication, and design choices that support the advancement of equity, inclusion, and justice.

### General Data Visualization Considerations

#### **Take a user-centered design approach**

Consider who the audience will be for the product you're developing and make decisions that will prioritize their needs so they are able to easily and efficiently use, engage, interact, and experience the product.

***Research*** - Let's use an equity lens here. Instead of "researching" your users and audience, try getting to know them by prioritizing relationship building and engagement. Ideally, by the time you're at the data visualization phase, you have already identified key partners and have been working or engaging with them during other phases of the project. See the [Planning](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/plan.html) section on [collecting expert input](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/plan.html#step-3.-collect-expert-input-including-from-affected-community-members) for more guidance on outreach and engagement.

***Empathy*** - According to Dr. Brené Brown: [empathy is about feeling *WITH people, and requires four qualities*](https://bouldercrest.org/resources/brene-brown-what-is-empathy/):

-   Perspective Taking, or putting yourself in someone else’s shoes
-   Staying out of judgement and listening
-   Recognizing emotion in another person that you have maybe felt before
-   Communicating that you can recognize that emotion

Integrating empathy into our data-intensive work requires us to consider how our audience and/or the communities whose data are being used will percieve or be impacted by our work. It means ensuring we're developing the product and thinking about the data as more than mere points on a map or visualization, but as representing real humans, environments, or conditions that should be contextualized and considered with care. Some [questions to consider include](https://datajournalism.com/read/longreads/data-visualisations-with-empathy):

-   Who is vulnerable in this context and how would they want to be counted?
-   What information would they need to improve their lives?
-   Who is undercounted or possibly missing entirely?
-   Who was counted? Who did the counting? Why were they asking these people?
-   Who benefits or is harmed if you forget the dots are people?

***Iteration*** - The key here is knowing and planning for an iterative process from the beginning of your process. Add that feedback, implementation, and testing loop into your plan and allocate appropriate time to each piece to occur. When working with partners or communities using an iterative approach, be sure to consider:

-   When it is appropriate to ask for feedback, and when it might be burdensome
-   Different ways feedback might be gathered. We might think sending an email with a poll or survey linked is the easiest, but our partner might find it easier to talk through questions over the phone with you. Knowing which method(s) to use comes with time and relationship. When in doubt - ask for what people prefer and do your best to accommodate those requests.
-   How much time is adequate for folks to be able to review what you send them and provide their feedback. When in doubt - plan for a longer feedback period than you think might be needed and confirm timelines with your partners (and adjust them if you can when your partners indicate more time is needed)

#### **Consider who is missing from the data**

It's not uncommon for project teams to have gaps in data, even after all of your work and investment into the [planning](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/plan.html), [data preparation](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/prep.html) and [collection](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/collect-process/collection.html) steps of the project. Often, this limitation of the data is out of your control - especially when you are using data from external sources. When this happens, it's important to acknowledge, document, communicate those gaps and who is not adequately represented in your data product in a way that is accessible.

#### **Consider how you group the data**

How we aggregate or disaggregate the data can impact which groups are "seen" and well represented (or not) in our visualizations. This can also influence who is centered, valued, or prioritized in the narrative of the visualization, and who is excluded.

Carefully consider how groups are lumped or split - by aggregating many groups in the visualization beyond what might be statistically necessary (and not acknowledging who is being grouped together and why), we can unintentionally misrepresent said groups, minimize inequities and perpetuate invisible and erased experiences of those communities. The [UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup](https://ncstoragemlunchealthcare.blob.core.windows.net/public/pdf-system-data-visualization-standards.pdf) recommends we ask ourselves the following questions when we're thinking about how we will aggregate the data (or not):

-   **Is important data/nuance lost by combining categories?** Ensure there is not a meaningful difference in equity outcomes between groups that would be lost if combined.

-   **Does the inclusion of uncombined data negatively impact the interpretation of the data visualization?** Having too many groups can make visualizations cluttered and hard to interpret. Additionally, disaggregation leads to smaller group sizes, making comparisons to larger groups more difficult and making statistical significance more challenging. For that reason, it can sometimes be best to combine groups.

-   **Does sharing uncombined data compromise confidential information (e.g., Personal Identifiable Information) or information considered private by the community from which it comes (e.g., locations of sacred tribal practices)?** This will depend on the audience you are sharing the visualization with (e.g. internal vs public) and what information it contains.

If you ultimately decide to aggregate / combine groups, be sure to:

1.  **Be transparent** about why you're making those decisions (including the trade offs you considered) and documenting those decisions accordingly.

2.  **Acknowledge who is now not included** in the data or visualization and explain what groups have been combined and why. Use comments, tooltips, or footnotes that can be easily accessed within the visualization to make it easier for users to find this information.

3.  **Think carefully about how groups are lumped in the "other" category** of our analysis or visualization. Sometimes it's necessary to combine groups into a single "other" category (e.g. to generalize small groups to protect confidentiality or to achieve adequate sample size for your analysis). The Urban Institute's [Do No Harm Data Visualizaation Recommendations](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2021/06/08/do-no-harm-guide-recommendations.pdf) include considering alternatives to using the term "other" as a catch-all category, including:

-   Another (e.g. Another race or Another group)
-   Additional (e.g. Additional races or Additional languages)
-   All other self-descriptions
-   People identifying as other or multiple races
-   Identity not listed
-   Identity not listed in the survey or dataset

#### **Use plain, accessible, and inclusive language**

***Plain Language*** - Plain language is writing designed to ensure the audience can understand what you're trying to communicate as easily, quickly, and comprehensively as possible. This means:

-   Avoiding convoluted or verbose language
-   Avoiding the use of jargon and acronyms
-   Making critical information easy to see and understand
-   Using a conversational rather than legal or bureaucratic tone

For more guidance on plain language, see:

-   [Center for Plain Language](https://centerforplainlanguage.org/learning-training/five-steps-plain-language/)
-   [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/)
-   Water Boards Staff may also [request plain language review from the Office of Public Participation](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/OPP/Resources/SitePages/Home.aspx), although that service is more geared towards the review of fact sheets, brochures, and FAQs rather than data visualizations or other data products.
-   Healthy Watershed Partnership [Guidance on Communicating Results](https://mywaterquality.ca.gov/monitoring_council/healthy_watersheds/assessment_guidance/communicate_results.html)

***Accessible Language*** - Making language accessible to your audience may also require the translation of products (or product components) into the languages used by your audience. The [Water Board's Linguistic Isolation Tool](https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjc0YjQ2ZWQtZWU2OS00N2NjLTllODgtY2VhOTk3NDBkMjM2IiwidCI6ImZlMTg2YTI1LTdkNDktNDFlNi05OTQxLTA1ZDIyODFkMzZjMSJ9&pageName=ReportSection) can be used to help understand the different languages that are used by communities across the state.

Water Boards Staff may also [request translation services from the Office of Public Participation](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/OPP/Resources/SitePages/Language%20Services.aspx?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=arv47O), although that service is more geared towards the translation of documents, rather than data visualizations or other data products.

***Inclusive Language*** - Words matter. It's important to be mindful of the language and terms we use in general (see [Non-Inclusive Terms to Avoid](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/get-started/common-language.html#non-inclusive-terms-to-avoid) for some examples). The language we use in our products can be a way for us to show respect, empathy, and care for the communities connected to or impacted by the data. The [UNC Health’s Equity and Inclusion Analytics Workgroup](https://ncstoragemlunchealthcare.blob.core.windows.net/public/pdf-system-data-visualization-standards.pdf) recommends we ask ourselves the following questions when we need to decide on language to use in our data products:

-   **Do the words seek to fix, blame, shame, or change communities that are most marginalized, OR do they seek to address the oppressive systems that impact these communities?**

-   **Are the words racialized?** Do the terms have a racist or colonialist implication? An example is the phrase “at risk.” Close your eyes and say the phrase “at risk.” Does a picture of a certain group or community come to mind? If so, stop and pick another word.

-   **Is the language people-centered?** Or do the phrases objectify communities? Distinguish between calling communities a name and describing what they are experiencing. For example: “people with disabilities,” “a person with asthma,” or “communities of color.”

-   **How am I framing the words?** What is the context and culture we are creating and perpetuating by using the words? Are the words positioning the communities we serve to live in their personal and collective power while addressing systemic oppression?

-   **Do the words dehumanize the communities we serve?** Words that take away agency, self-determination, and personal power and do not recognize communities’ inherent strengths and assets should be avoided.

#### **Tell a story with the data** 

> "While data may seem cut and dry, people are not"

> \- [P. Kim Bui](https://datajournalism.com/contributors/pkimbui), Director of audience innovation at the Arizona Republic and author of [Designing data visualisations with empathy](https://datajournalism.com/read/longreads/data-visualisations-with-empathy)

[Humans are hardwired for story](https://medium.com/the-protagonist/the-science-behind-storytelling-51169758b22c). Plopping points on a map or throwing together an interactive chart without adding context is not only insufficient, its ineffective!

Take the time to tell a story with the visualization or product you're developing. Walk the audience through the the messages you want to convey, and back it up with the data. If you're unsure what the story of your data is, or how to communicate it effectively, try collecting your thoughts using a [COMPASS Message Box](https://www.compassscicomm.org/the-message-box-workbook):

[![The COMPASS Message Box is a tool to help scientists sort and distill their (often technical or complex) knowledge in a way that will resonate with their chosen audience. Users complete the sections in any order and can then use the distilled information to communicate their science more effectively.](images/compass-box.png){fig-alt="The COMPASS Message Box with six sections and associated brainstorm questions: Audience (Who is impacted by this? Who can change this? Who cares about this?), Issue (Broadly, what are you working on? What keywords would you search to find your topic online?), Problems? (What specific dimension of the issue are you addressing?), So What? (What does your audience value? How does this impact them or something they care about?), Solutions? (What can be done to address the problem? Or what are you doing to address it?) and Benefits? (Who does this help and how? What improves in the short-term? Long-term?)"}](https://www.compassscicomm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Message-Box-Workbook.pdf)
