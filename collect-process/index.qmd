# Collect & Process

At this phase, you should have already completed your equity assessment ([Planning](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan.html)) and developed your data management plan using an equity lens ([Data Preparation](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/prep.html)). Now you're ready to begin the data work!

This phase of the data life cycle involves gathering the data you identified during the Plan & Prep phase ([Data Collection](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/collect-process/collection.html)) and getting it ready so it can be used in your analyses or product development steps ([Data Processing](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/collect-process/process.html)).
