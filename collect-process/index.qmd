# Collect & Process

This phase of the data life cycle involves gathering the data you identified during the Plan & Prep phases ([Data Collection](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/collect-process/collection.html)) and getting it ready so it can be used in your analyses or product development steps ([Data Processing](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/collect-process/process.html)).
