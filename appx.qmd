## Appendix A: Glossary & Non-Inclusive Terms to Avoid

### Glossary

Below are a set of key terms and definitions provided by the Water Board Racial Equity Team in the development of the [Racial Equity Resolution](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/resolutions/2021/rs2021_0050.pdf) and [Racial Equity Action Plan](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/racial_equity/docs/racial-equity-action-plan-final-en.pdf) and are those that we adhere to in this Handbook. (citations can be found [here](https://waterboards.ca.gov/racial_equity/information-and-resources.html#terminology)).

For a more comprehensive list of equity-related terms, see the [Racial Equity Tools Glossary](https://www.racialequitytools.org/glossary). A more extensive list of data terms and definitions can also be found in the [College of Water Informatics Data Glossary.](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/cowi/glossary.html)

-   **Disadvantaged Community** (DAC) is defined by the California Water Code as a community in which the median household income (MHI) is less than 80 percent of the statewide annual MHI (CA Water Code Section 13149.2 and 79505.5(a)). At the time this document was developed, the statewide annual MHI from the U.S. Census Bureau from 2017-2021 was \$84,097 ([U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: California](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/CA/INC110220)). Based on this data, a community with a household income of less than \$67,278 qualifies as a DAC based on the Water Code definition.

-   **Equality** describes circumstances in which each individual or group is given the same or equal treatment, including the same resources, opportunities, and support. However, because different individuals or groups have different histories, needs, and circumstances, they do not have equal positions in society or starting points. Providing the same resources, support, or treatment does not guarantee that everyone will have fair or equal outcomes.

-   **Ethnicity** is a term used to describe subgroups of a population that share characteristics such as language, values, behavioral patterns, history, and ancestral geographical base. Social scientists often use the terms ethnicity and ethnic group to avoid the perception of biological significance associated with race.

-   **Intersectionality** is a term used to describe the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine, overlap and intersect especially in the experiences of marginalized individuals or groups.

-   **Institutional racism** describes the ways in which policies and practices perpetuated by institutions, including governments and private groups, produce different outcomes for different racial groups in a manner that benefits the dominant group. In the United States, institutional racism includes policies that may not mention race but still tends to result in benefiting white people over people of color.

-   **Race** is a social construct used to categorize humans into groups based on combinations of shared physical traits such as skin color, hair texture, nose shape, eye shape, or head shape. Although most scientists agree that such groupings lack biological meaning, racial groups continue to have a strong influence over contemporary social relations. Historically in the United States, race has frequently been used to concentrate power with white people and legitimize dominance over non-white people.

-   **Racial equity** means Race can no longer be used to predict life outcomes and outcomes for all groups are improved. For example, when we hold income constant, there are still large inequities based on race across multiple indicators for success, including the environment, education, jobs, incarceration, health and housing. 

-   **Racism** is any prejudice against someone because of their race when systems of power reinforce those views. 

-   **Structural racism** is the normalization and legitimization of an array of historical, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal dynamics that routinely advantage whites while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for people of color. Structural racism encompasses the entire system of white domination, diffused, and infused in all aspects of society, including its history, culture, politics, economics, and whole social fabric. Structural racism is more difficult to locate in a particular institution because it involves the reinforcing effects of multiple institutions and cultural norms, past and present, continually reproducing old and producing new forms of racism. Structural racism is the most profound and pervasive form of racism; all other forms of racism emerge from structural racism.

-   **Systemic racism** can be said to encompass both institutional and structural racism. Glenn Harris, president of Race Forward, defines systemic racism as “the complex interaction of culture, policy and institutions that holds in place the outcomes we see in our lives.”  The legacy of systemic racism can be seen in a variety of outcomes affecting people of color, such as housing insecurity, a ten-fold wealth gap between white and Black or Latinx households, a dramatic over-representation of people of color in prison, and disparities in education, health, and exposure to environmental pollution.

### Non-Inclusive Terms to Avoid

Below are a set of common terms that are non-inclusive particularly to Black and Indigenous People and are commonly used in the workplace that have the potential to exclude and alienate people. This is not an exhaustive list but we recommend that research be conducted to review non-inclusive terms that may be used and have a history prior to engaging with communities.

-   **Blacklist** - Blacklist typically refers to the ostracizing of a person, group, or organization that prevents them from participating in specific activities or spaces. This issue with the word blacklist is the association of the color with negative, evil, or wrong, and the racist undertones associated with it, and can be harmful.

    -   Alternatives: blocked, closed off, inaccessible, blocked list, banned, or closed list

-   **Brown Bag** - The term “brown bag” has a historical connotation with creating an exclusive gathering that required attendees to have a lighter skin tone than a brown paper bag to participate and gain access.

    -   Alternatives: lunch in, lunch and learn, presentation, seminar

-   **Chief** - this term is used throughout the Water Boards to indicate positions and job titles.  This term is appropriated from the Indigenous Peoples of North America and should be avoided wherever possible.

    -   Alternatives: manager, lead, head

-   **Grandfathered in** - The American South created absurd voting requirements that targeted Black people and made it almost impossible to vote. The name for these requirements is the "Grandfather Clause." They wrote the Amendment in a way to imply the practice was not discriminatory. They created stringent new voter requirements such as literacy tests. These requirements did not apply to people who had voted before 1867. Slaves did not know they were free until June 19, 1865. However, slavery was abolished on January 1, 1863, making it nearly impossible for a person formally kept in captivity to be legally allowed to vote.

    -   Alternatives:  legacied, exempted, preapproved

-   **Master \_\_\_\_** - using the term "master" to describe something that is the main or centralized source of information is inappropriate due to the connotations associated with slavery.

    -   Alternatives: primary, main

-   **Pow wow** - Social gatherings for ceremonial and celebratory purposes conducted under strict protocols. Avoid using the phrase to refer to a quick business meeting or informal social gathering as this is a form of cultural appropriation.

    -   Alternatives: meeting, gathering, or huddle

-   **Spirit Animal -** These are spiritual guides that take the form of animals often viewed as sacred in tribal cultures. Non-native people appropriate the term to relate themselves to an animal, inanimate object, or person and draw parallels between the person and object’s characteristics. For example, saying that a sloth is your spirit animal because you are slow, lazy, and/or sleepy.

    -   Alternatives: patronus, kindred spirit, reason for living, muse, guide, or familiar.

-   **Stakeholder -** The issue with the word stakeholder is that in a colonial context, a stakeholder was the person who drove a stake into the land to demarcate the land s/he was occupying/stealing from Indigenous territories. Continued use of the term can be construed as disrespectful of Indigenous people as well as perpetuating colonization and re-traumatization. 

    -   Alternatives: interested parties, partners, collaborators  

-   **Totem Pole** - Pieces of wood carved with a person’s totems. It is a tradition particular to Native and Indigenous people on the Northwest Coast. They tend to convey a family or tribe’s history. Avoid using phrases like “low on the totem pole” or “climbing the totem pole” as these are forms of cultural appropriation. These phrases are also inaccurate because in some First Nation communities being lower on the totem pole is a higher honor.

    -   Alternatives: climbing the corporate ladder, the lowest rung on the latter, least significant, or promotion.

-   **White Paper** - while this term is widely used to describe an authoritative document, the term has historical implications that evoke negative associations especially with Tribes. 

    -   Alternatives: Issue paper, briefing document, prospectus

## Appendix B: Beware of Common Types of Survey Bias

The bulk of content in this appendix has been informed by: [A Catalog of Biases in Questionnaires](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1323316/).

### Biases Associated with Question Design

While the specific sources below vary, they can generally be caused by one or more of the following issues: problematic wording, data for the intended purpose of the question is missing or inadequate, the scale included the question is faulty, questions that are leading, intrusive, or inconsistent.

+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Abrupt question**          | The question is too short and can come off as jarring to the respondent.                                                                                                                                                                        | Add a transition or introduction to the beginning of the question.                                                                                                                                       |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Ambiguous question**       | The question leads respondents to understand the question differently than was intended and, therefore, to answer a different question than was intended                                                                                        | Have a trusted partner, but one who had not participated in survey development, review and provide feedback on questions.                                                                                |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Complex question**         | The question is usually long, vague, too formal, or overly complex.                                                                                                                                                                             | Keep questions short and to the point.                                                                                                                                                                   |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Data degradation**         | The question is phrased in a way that encourages respondents to provide less accurate information, which cannot be recovered or made more accurate after the survey is complete.                                                                | Phrase questions in a manner that collects the most accurate information (ideally in the form of continuous data)                                                                                        |
|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                              | Note that sometimes it is more beneficial to collect generalized information so that you can prevent the unnecessary collection of Personal Identifiable Information (PII).                                                                     | Example: What age category do you belong to? ➔ What is your age?

+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Double-barreled question** | The question is made up of two or more questions, and therefore make it difficult for the respondent to know which part of the question to answer and for the investigator to know which part of the question the respondent actually answered. | Separate questions so that each question is only asking for one thing.                                                                                                                                   |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Forced choice**            | The question provides too few categories that results in the respondents being forced to choose an imprecise option.                                                                                                                            | Add one or more of the below category options to your question:                                                                                                                                          |

| **Juxtaposed scale**                | This is often referred to as a Likert Scale question, which displays a list of single-answer questions and a rating scale for the answers, so a respondent can select a value from the scale to answer each question.       | The advantage of using Juxtaposed (aka Likert) scale formatting is that it can force respondents to think about and compare their responses for each item because they are side by side.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **No-saying**/ **yes-saying**       | For groups of questions that only include statements associated with yes/no response options, respondents tend to answer yes to all questions or no to all questions.                                                       | Use both positive and negative statements about the same issue sprinkled through the group of questions to break up the pattern and encourage respondents to consider one question at a time, rather than to group them together.                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Non-response**                    | Even with adequate sample representation (see below), individuals are choosing not to respond to your survey.                                                                                                               | Consider when and how you are reaching out to your audience.

| **Skipping questions**              | Questions that instruct respondents to skip to another question based on their response can lead to the loss of important information.                                                                                      | Be sure questions that will be skipped cannot be applied to different respondents based on their first response.

| Danger of Summary Metrics                           | Only looking at summary metrics and missing big differences in the raw data.                                                                    | Summary metrics or descriptive analytics can (and should!) be used to help us understand out data. However, it's important to remember that they cannot tell us anything about why we're seeing the results, patterns, or trends that are identified. Be sure to use summary metrics in concert with context and other analyses so you can see your data holistically. \| \|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

During your [Plan and Prepare](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/plan-prep/) phase, think through what geographic units are most appropriate for your project needs. Know that the data you have access to might be in one geographic unit (e.g. census tract, hydrologic unit code (HUC)) but your questions are related to a different unit (e.g. county, region, statewide) - so you may need to do some analyses to standardize units. Doing so has its benefits and [limitations](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/collect-process/collection.html#data-limitations). No matter what analytical decision you make, it's important to clearly [document](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/documentation.html) the reasoning behind your decision.                                                                           |

| Hawthorne Effect                                    | The act of monitoring someone can affect their behavior, leading to spurious findings.                                                          | This may not be directly relevant in the usual data work you do. However, it is particularly important when delivering [surveys](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/equity-data-handbook/collect-process/collection.html#surveys). Keep that in mind as you design, deliver, and analyze survey results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Publication Bias                                    | Interesting research findings are more likely to be published, distorting our impression of reality.                                            | It's important to remember that academic systems - like our government systems and including publishing institutions - have racist origins and biases that have excluded the science, research, and ways of knowing that have come from of Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) communities. This is why taking the time to develop relationships and partnerships with the communities our decisions and actions may impact is crucial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Regression Towards the Mean                         | When something happens that’s unusually good or bad, it will revert back towards the average over time.                                         | A key component of this fallacy is that random chance influences the outcome. When looking at our data through an equity lens, we need to remember that racism and injustice are central to our collective history and can be traced back to *before* the founding of our country. We live and work in institutions and systems that have inherited those unjust decisions and processes. We know that, as government representatives, if we're not clear and intentional about advancing racial equity in the work we do, it won’t happen and we will continue to perpetuate racial inequity. In other words, because of the unjust systems in which we work, we cannot depend on this fallacy and wait for the unusually "bad" or unjust results/trends to correct themselves or revert back to more equitable trends. **Because government agencies created and perpetuated environmental racism, it is [our responsibility]{.underline} to proactively advance racial equity and justice in all the work we do.** |

If the data available is not adequately representative, then you may need to revise the types of questions you have of the data (and analytical methods). Or, it might be worth considering collecting the data yourself or with partners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Sometimes the data we need to understand every aspect of ideal our project objectives simply does not exist or is not accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
