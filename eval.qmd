# Evaluation

After a project is complete (or has gone through a complete iteration) - it's important to assess the project and evaluate the extent to which it has achieved the goals you set for it and advanced and improved equity outcomes. There are several ways to achieve this. Below is a list of methods one might consider utilizing for this phase of the data life cycle.

Depending on what you discover during the evaluation process, you may need to undergo a second phase or iteration of the project to integrate lessons and get closer to achieving the original goals and desired equity outcomes.
